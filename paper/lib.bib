  abstract = {Traffic forecasting is attracting considerable interest due to its widespread application in intelligent transportation systems. Given the complex and dynamic traffic data, many methods focus on how to establish a spatial-temporal model to express the non-stationary traffic patterns. Recently, the latest Graph Convolution Network (GCN) has been introduced to learn spatial features while the time neural networks are used to learn temporal features. These GCN based methods obtain state-of-the-art performance. However, the current GCN based methods ignore the natural hierarchical structure of traffic systems which is composed of the micro layers of road networks and the macro layers of region networks, in which the nodes are obtained through pooling method and could include some hot traffic regions such as downtown and CBD etc., while the current GCN is only applied on the micro graph of road networks. In this paper, we propose a novel Hierarchical Graph Convolution Networks (HGCN) for traffic forecasting by operating on both the micro and macro traffic graphs. The proposed method is evaluated on two complex city traffic speed datasets. Compared to the latest GCN based methods like Graph WaveNet, the proposed HGCN gets higher traffic forecasting precision with lower computational cost.The website of the code is https://github.com/guokan987/HGCN.git.},

  abstract = {Hierarchical forecasting (HF) is needed in many situations in the supply chain (SC) because managers often need different levels of forecasts at different levels of SC to make a decision. Top-Down (TD), Bottom-Up (BU) and Optimal Combination (COM) are common HF models. These approaches are static and often ignore the dynamics of the series while disaggregating them. Consequently, they may fail to perform well if the investigated group of time series are subject to large changes such as during the periods of promotional sales. We address the HF problem of predicting real-world sales time series that are highly impacted by promotion. We use three machine learning (ML) models to capture sales variations over time. Artificial neural networks (ANN), extreme gradient boosting (XGboost), and support vector regression (SVR) algorithms are used to estimate the proportions of lower-level time series from the upper level. We perform an in-depth analysis of 61 groups of time series with different volatilities and show that ML models are competitive and outperform some well-established models in the literature.},

  abstract = {Model selection has been proven an effective strategy for improving accuracy in time series forecasting applications. However, when dealing with hierarchical time series, apart from selecting the most appropriate forecasting model, forecasters have also to select a suitable method for reconciling the base forecasts produced for each series to make sure they are coherent. Although some hierarchical forecasting methods like minimum trace are strongly supported both theoretically and empirically for reconciling the base forecasts, there are still circumstances under which they might not produce the most accurate results, being outperformed by other methods. In this paper we propose an approach for dynamically selecting the most appropriate hierarchical forecasting method and succeeding better forecasting accuracy along with coherence. The approach, to be called conditional hierarchical forecasting, is based on Machine Learning classification methods and uses time series features as leading indicators for performing the selection for each hierarchy examined considering a variety of alternatives. Our results suggest that conditional hierarchical forecasting leads to significantly more accurate forecasts than standard approaches, especially at lower hierarchical levels.},

  abstract = {As we reach the apex of the COVID-19 pandemic across the globe, the most pressing question facing us all is: can we, even partially, reopen the economy without risking the second wave? Towards answering this question, we first need to understand if shutting down the economy helped. And second if it did, is it possible to achieve similar gains in the war against the pandemic while partially opening up the economy? To do so, it is critical to understand the effects of the various interventions that can be put into place and their corresponding health and economic implications. Since many possible interventions exist, the key challenge facing policy makers is understanding the potential trade-offs between them, and choosing the particular set of interventions that works best for their circumstance \textendash{} for example, what would be the effect on COVID-19 related deaths if the U.S. had decreased mobility by 20\% instead of 60\% versus if Italy had done the same? In this memo, we provide an overview of Synthetic Interventions [3] (a natural generalization of the widely applied Synthetic Control method [2]), which is a data-driven and statistically principled method to perform what-if scenario planning, i.e., for policy makers to understand the trade-offs between different interventions before having to actually enact them. In essence, the Synthetic Interventions method leverages information from different interventions that have already been enacted across the world and fits it to a policy maker's setting of interest \textendash{} for instance, to estimate the effect of mobility-restricting interventions on the U.S., we use daily death data from countries that enforced severe mobility restrictions to create a ``synthetic low mobility U.S.'' and predict the counterfactual trajectory of the U.S. if it had indeed applied a similar intervention.},

However, currently there remains a performance gap to more expressive stochastic RNN variants, especially those with several layers of dependent random variables. In this work, we propose stochastic temporal convolutional networks (STCNs), a novel architecture that combines the computational advantages of temporal convolutional networks (TCN) with the representational power and robustness of stochastic latent spaces. In particular, we propose a hierarchy of stochastic latent variables that captures temporal dependencies at different time-scales. The architecture is modular and flexible due to decoupling of deterministic and stochastic layers. We show that the proposed architecture achieves state of the art log-likelihoods across several tasks. Finally, the model is capable of predicting high-quality synthetic samples over a long-range temporal horizon in modeling of handwritten text.},

In particular, we consider nonlinear-Gaussian state-space models in which sequential approximate inference results in the factorization of a data matrix into a dictionary and time-varying coefficients with (possibly nonlinear) Markovian dependencies. The assumed Markovian structure on the coefficients enables us to encode temporal dependencies into a low-dimensional feature space. The proposed inference method is solely based on an approximate extended Kalman filtering scheme which makes the resulting method particularly efficient. The PSMF can account for temporal nonlinearities and, more importantly, can be used to calibrate and estimate generic differentiable nonlinear subspace models. We show that the PSMF can be used in multiple contexts: modelling time series with a periodic subspace, robustifying changepoint detection methods, and imputing missing-data in high-dimensional time-series of air pollutants measured across London.},

Multiple market factors contribute to the highly variable nature of freight flows, which calls for adaptive and responsive forecasting models. This paper presents a demand forecasting methodology that supports freight operation planning over short to long term horizons. The method combines time series models and machine learning algorithms in a Reinforcement Learning framework applied over a rolling horizon. The objective is to develop an efficient method that reduces the prediction error by taking full advantage of the traditional time series models and machine learning models. In a case study applied to container shipment data for a US intermodal company, the approach succeeded in reducing the forecast error margin. It also allowed predictions to closely follow recent trends and fluctuations in the market while minimizing the need for user intervention. The results indicate that the proposed approach is an effective method to predict freight demand. In addition to clustering and Reinforcement Learning, a method for converting monthly forecasts to long-term weekly forecasts was developed and tested. The results suggest that these monthly-to-weekly long-term forecasts outperform the direct long term forecasts generated through typical time series approaches.},

In particular, smart meters play a key role in this transformation as they allow tracking electricity load consumption at a very disaggregated level and at high frequency rates. This data opens the possibility of developing new forecasting models with a potential positive impact in both electricity distribution and retailing activities. In this work, we present a general methodology that is able to process and forecast a large number of smart meter time series. Instead of using traditional and univariate approaches for each time series, we develop a single but complex recurrent neural network model with long short-term memory that is able to capture individual consumption patterns and also the cross-sectional relations among different households. The resulting model can accurately predict future loads (short-term) of individual consumers, even if these were not included in the original training set (out-of-sample consumers). This entails a great potential for large scale applications (Big Data) as once the single network is trained, accurate individual forecast for new consumers can be obtained at almost no computational cost. The performance of the proposed model is tested under a large set of numerical experiments by using a real world dataset with thousands of disaggregated electricity consumption time series. Furthermore, we exploit the considered dataset to explore how geo-demographic segmentation of consumers can improve the forecasting accuracy of the proposed model.},

It is usual that e-commerce companies face situations where they want to promote and sell new or discounted items. In these situations, we have to consider a question: who are interested in the items and how to find them? This paper answers this question by addressing a new problem called reverse maximum inner product search (reverse MIPS). Given a query vector and two sets of vectors (user vectors and item vectors), the problem of reverse MIPS finds a set of user vectors whose inner product with the query vector is the maximum among the query and item vectors. Although the importance of this problem is clear, its straightforward implementation incurs a computationally expensive cost. We therefore propose Simpfer, a simple, fast, and exact algorithm for reverse MIPS. In an offline phase, Simpfer builds a simple index that maintains a lower-bound of the maximum inner product. By exploiting this index, Simpfer judges whether the query vector can have the maximum inner product or not, for a given user vector, in a constant time. Besides, our index enables filtering user vectors, which cannot have the maximum inner product with the query vector, in a batch. We theoretically demonstrate that Simpfer outperforms baselines employing state-of-the-art MIPS techniques. Furthermore, our extensive experiments on real datasets show that Simpfer is at least two orders magnitude faster than the baselines.},

To address these questions computationally, we formalize "Coordination Strategy Inference Problem". In this setting, a group of multiple individuals moves in a coordinated manner towards a target path. Each individual uses a specific strategy to follow others (e.g. nearest neighbors, pre-defined leaders, preferred friends). Given a set of time series that includes coordinated movement and a set of candidate strategies as inputs, we provide the first methodology (to the best of our knowledge) to infer whether each individual uses local-agreement-system or dictatorship-like strategy to achieve movement coordination at the group level. We evaluate and demonstrate the performance of the proposed framework by predicting the direction of movement of an individual in a group in both simulated datasets as well as two real-world datasets: a school of fish and a troop of baboons. Moreover, since there is no prior methodology for inferring individual-level strategies, we compare our framework with the state-of-the-art approach for the task of classification of group-level-coordination models. The results show that our approach is highly accurate in inferring the correct strategy in simulated datasets even in complicated mixed strategy settings, which no existing method can infer. In the task of classification of group-level-coordination models, our framework performs better than the state-of-the-art approach in all datasets. Animal data experiments show that fish, as expected, follow their neighbors, while baboons have a preference to follow specific individuals.

We propose the MAP (Maximizing Airline Profits) architecture designed to help airlines and make two key contributions in airline market share and route demand prediction and prediction-based airline profit optimization. Compared with past methods to forecast market share and demand along airline routes, we introduce a novel Ensemble Forecasting (MAP-EF) approach considering two new classes of features: (i) features derived from clusters of similar routes, and (ii) features based on equilibrium pricing. We show that MAP-EF achieves much better Pearson Correlation Coefficients (over 0.95 vs. 0.82 for market share, 0.98 vs. 0.77 for demand) and R2-values compared with three stateof-the-art works for forecasting market share and demand, while showing much lower variance. Using the results of MAP-EF, we develop MAP-Bilevel Branch and Bound (MAP-BBB) and MAPGreedy (MAP-G) algorithms to optimally allocate flight frequencies over multiple routes, to maximize an airline's profit. Experimental results show that airlines can increase profits by a significant margin. All experiments were conducted with data aggregated from four sources: US Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS), US Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA), the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), and the US Census Bureau (CB).},

Extensive research focuses on improving the accuracy of each hierarchy, especially the intermittent time series at bottom levels. Then hierarchical reconciliation could be used to improve the overall performance further. In this paper, we present a \textbackslash emph\{hierarchical-forecasting-with-alignment\} approach that treats the bottom level forecasts as mutable to ensure higher forecasting accuracy on the upper levels of the hierarchy. We employ a pure deep learning forecasting approach N-BEATS for continuous time series at the top levels and a widely used tree-based algorithm LightGBM for the intermittent time series at the bottom level. The \textbackslash emph\{hierarchical-forecasting-with-alignment\} approach is a simple yet effective variant of the bottom-up method, accounting for biases that are difficult to observe at the bottom level. It allows suboptimal forecasts at the lower level to retain a higher overall performance. The approach in this empirical study was developed by the first author during the M5 Forecasting Accuracy competition, ranking second place. The method is also business orientated and could benefit for business strategic planning.},

We assign Bayesian Neural Nets (BNNs) to both the drift and the diffusion terms of a Stochastic Differential Equation (SDE) that models the flow of the activation map in time.

  abstract = {Deep neural networks are composed of layers of parametrised linear operations intertwined with non linear activations. In basic models, such as the multi-layer perceptron, a linear layer operates on a simple input vector embedding of the instance being processed, and produces an output vector embedding by straight multiplication by a matrix parameter. In more complex models, the input and output are structured and their embeddings are higher order tensors. The parameter of each linear operation must then be controlled so as not to explode with the complexity of the structures involved. This is essentially the role of convolution models, which exist in many flavours dependent on the type of structure they deal with (grids, networks, time series etc.). We present here a unified framework which aims at capturing the essence of these diverse models, allowing a systematic analysis of their properties and their mutual enrichment. We also show that attention models naturally fit in the same framework: attention is convolution in which the structure itself is adaptive, and learnt, instead of being given a priori.},

  abstract = {Black-box machine learning models are now routinely used in high-risk settings, like medical diagnostics, which demand uncertainty quantification to avoid consequential model failures. Conformal prediction is a user-friendly paradigm for creating statistically rigorous uncertainty sets/intervals for the predictions of such models. Critically, the sets are valid in a distribution-free sense: they possess explicit, non-asymptotic guarantees even without distributional assumptions or model assumptions. One can use conformal prediction with any pre-trained model, such as a neural network, to produce sets that are guaranteed to contain the ground truth with a user-specified probability, such as 90\%. It is easy-to-understand, easy-to-use, and general, applying naturally to problems arising in the fields of computer vision, natural language processing, deep reinforcement learning, and so on. This hands-on introduction is aimed to provide the reader a working understanding of conformal prediction and related distribution-free uncertainty quantification techniques with one self-contained document. We lead the reader through practical theory for and examples of conformal prediction and describe its extensions to complex machine learning tasks involving structured outputs, distribution shift, time-series, outliers, models that abstain, and more. Throughout, there are many explanatory illustrations, examples, and code samples in Python. With each code sample comes a Jupyter notebook implementing the method on a real-data example; the notebooks can be accessed and easily run using our codebase.},

One might hope that when used with privately trained models, conformal prediction would yield privacy guarantees for the resulting prediction sets; unfortunately this is not the case. To remedy this key problem, we develop a method that takes any pretrained predictive model and outputs differentially private prediction sets. Our method follows the general approach of split conformal prediction; we use holdout data to calibrate the size of the prediction sets but preserve privacy by using a privatized quantile subroutine. This subroutine compensates for the noise introduced to preserve privacy in order to guarantee correct coverage. We evaluate the method on large-scale computer vision data sets.},

  abstract = {Predicting the outcome of sports events is a hard task. We quantify this difficulty with a coefficient that measures the distance between the observed final results of sports leagues and idealized perfectly balanced competitions in terms of skill. This indicates the relative presence of luck and skill. We collected and analyzed all games from 198 sports leagues comprising 1503 seasons from 84 countries of 4 different sports: basketball, soccer, volleyball and handball. We measured the competitiveness by countries and sports. We also identify in each season which teams, if removed from its league, result in a completely random tournament. Surprisingly, not many of them are needed. As another contribution of this paper, we propose a probabilistic graphical model to learn about the teams' skills and to decompose the relative weights of luck and skill in each game. We break down the skill component into factors associated with the teams' characteristics. The model also allows to estimate as 0.36 the probability that an underdog team wins in the NBA league, with a home advantage adding 0.09 to this probability. As shown in the first part of the paper, luck is substantially present even in the most competitive championships, which partially explains why sophisticated and complex feature-based models hardly beat simple models in the task of forecasting sports' outcomes.},

Recent work has shown that human feedback can be characterized as a critique of an agent's current behavior rather than as an alternative reward signal to be maximized, culminating in the COnvergent Actor-Critic by Humans (COACH) algorithm for making direct policy updates based on human feedback. Our work builds on COACH, moving to a setting where the agent's policy is represented by a deep neural network. We employ a series of modifications on top of the original COACH algorithm that are critical for successfully learning behaviors from high-dimensional observations, while also satisfying the constraint of obtaining reduced sample complexity. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our Deep COACH algorithm in the rich 3D world of Minecraft with an agent that learns to complete tasks by mapping from raw pixels to actions using only real-time human feedback in 10-15 minutes of interaction.},

These problems are challenging because of the existence of specific spatial, short-term and long-term patterns, and the curse of dimensionality. In this paper, we propose a deep neural network framework for large-scale spatial time series forecasting problems. We explicitly designed the neural network architecture for capturing various types of patterns. In preprocessing, a time series decomposition method is applied to separately feed short-term, long-term and spatial patterns into different components of a neural network. A fuzzy clustering method finds cluster of neighboring time series based on similarity of time series residuals; as they can be meaningful short-term patterns for spatial time series. In neural network architecture, each kernel of a multi-kernel convolution layer is applied to a cluster of time series to extract short-term features in neighboring areas. The output of convolution layer is concatenated by trends and followed by convolution-LSTM layer to capture long-term patterns in larger regional areas. To make a robust prediction when faced with missing data, an unsupervised pretrained denoising autoencoder reconstructs the output of the model in a fine-tuning step. The experimental results illustrate the model outperforms baseline and state of the art models in a traffic flow prediction dataset.},

Base forecasts can be computed by popular time series forecasting methods such as Exponential Smoothing (ETS) and Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) models. The reconciliation step is a linear process that adjusts the base forecasts to ensure they are coherent. However using ETS or ARIMA for base forecasts can be computationally challenging when there are a large number of series to forecast, as each model must be numerically optimized for each series. We propose a linear model that avoids this computational problem and handles the forecasting and reconciliation in a single step. The proposed method is very flexible in incorporating external data, handling missing values and model selection. We illustrate our approach using two datasets: monthly Australian domestic tourism and daily Wikipedia pageviews. We compare our approach to reconciliation using ETS and ARIMA, and show that our approach is much faster while providing similar levels of forecast accuracy.},

We have adapted an ensemble method to the problem of predicting future values of time series using recurrent neural networks (RNNs) as base learners. The improvement is made by combining a large number of RNNs, each of which is generated by training on a different set of examples. This algorithm is based on the boosting algorithm where difficult points of the time series are concentrated on during the learning process however, unlike the original algorithm, we introduce a new parameter for tuning the boosting influence on available examples. We test our boosting algorithm for RNNs on single-step-ahead and multi-step-ahead prediction problems. The results are then compared to other regression methods, including those of different local approaches. The overall results obtained through our ensemble method are more accurate than those obtained through the standard method, backpropagation through time, on these datasets and perform significantly better even when long-range dependencies play an important role.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a new univariate forecasting method. The method is based on the concept of modifying the local curvature of the time-series through a coefficient `Theta' (the Greek letter \texttheta ), that is applied directly to the second differences of the data. The resulting series that are created maintain the mean and the slope of the original data but not their curvatures. These new time series are named Theta-lines. Their primary qualitative characteristic is the improvement of the approximation of the long-term behavior of the data or the augmentation of the short-term features, depending on the value of the Theta coefficient. The proposed method decomposes the original time series into two or more different Theta-lines. These are extrapolated separately and the subsequent forecasts are combined. The simple combination of two Theta-lines, the Theta=0 (straight line) and Theta=2 (double local curves) was adopted in order to produce forecasts for the 3003 series of the M3 competition. The method performed well, particularly for monthly series and for microeconomic data.},

A temporal hierarchy can be constructed for any time series by means of non-overlapping temporal aggregation. Predictions constructed at all aggregation levels are combined with the proposed framework to result in temporally reconciled, accurate and robust forecasts. The implied combination mitigates modelling uncertainty, while the reconciled nature of the forecasts results in a unified prediction that supports aligned decisions at different planning horizons: from short-term operational up to long-term strategic planning. The proposed methodology is independent of forecasting models. It can embed high level managerial forecasts that incorporate complex and unstructured information with lower level statistical forecasts. Our results show that forecasting with temporal hierarchies increases accuracy over conventional forecasting, particularly under increased modelling uncertainty. We discuss organisational implications of the temporally reconciled forecasts using a case study of Accident \& Emergency departments.},

One yields better results than the current LightGBM, and has a similar computation time. The other one yields even better results, but is much slower than the current LightGBM. We also propose a heuristic that takes into account that greedily splitting a tree by choosing a monotone split with respect to its immediate gain is far from optimal. Then, we compare the results with the current implementation of the constraints in the LightGBM library, using the well known Adult public dataset. Throughout the report, we mostly focus on the implementation of our methods that we made for the LightGBM library, even though they are general and could be implemented in any regression or classification tree. The best method we propose (a smarter way to split the tree coupled to a penalization of monotone splits) consistently beats the current implementation of LightGBM. With small or average trees, the loss reduction can be as high as 1\% in the early stages of training and decreases to around 0.1\% at the loss peak for the Adult dataset. The results would be even better with larger trees. In our experiments, we didn't do a lot of tuning of the regularization parameters, and we wouldn't be surprised to see that increasing the performance of our methods on test sets.},

  abstract = {Training state-of-the-art, deep neural networks is computationally expensive. One way to reduce the training time is to normalize the activities of the neurons. A recently introduced technique called batch normalization uses the distribution of the summed input to a neuron over a mini-batch of training cases to compute a mean and variance which are then used to normalize the summed input to that neuron on each training case. This significantly reduces the training time in feedforward neural networks. However, the effect of batch normalization is dependent on the mini-batch size and it is not obvious how to apply it to recurrent neural networks. In this paper, we transpose batch normalization into layer normalization by computing the mean and variance used for normalization from all of the summed inputs to the neurons in a layer on a single training case. Like batch normalization, we also give each neuron its own adaptive bias and gain which are applied after the normalization but before the non-linearity. Unlike batch normalization, layer normalization performs exactly the same computation at training and test times. It is also straightforward to apply to recurrent neural networks by computing the normalization statistics separately at each time step. Layer normalization is very effective at stabilizing the hidden state dynamics in recurrent networks. Empirically, we show that layer normalization can substantially reduce the training time compared with previously published techniques.},

These algorithms have been evaluated on subsets of the 47 data sets in the University of California, Riverside time series classification archive. The archive has recently been expanded to 85 data sets, over half of which have been donated by researchers at the University of East Anglia. Aspects of previous evaluations have made comparisons between algorithms difficult. For example, several different programming languages have been used, experiments involved a single train/test split and some used normalised data whilst others did not. The relaunch of the archive provides a timely opportunity to thoroughly evaluate algorithms on a larger number of datasets. We have implemented 18 recently proposed algorithms in a common Java framework and compared them against two standard benchmark classifiers (and each other) by performing 100 resampling experiments on each of the 85 datasets. We use these results to test several hypotheses relating to whether the algorithms are significantly more accurate than the benchmarks and each other. Our results indicate that only 9 of these algorithms are significantly more accurate than both benchmarks and that one classifier, the Collective of Transformation Ensembles, is significantly more accurate than all of the others. All of our experiments and results are reproducible: we release all of our code, results and experimental details and we hope these experiments form the basis for more rigorous testing of new algorithms in the future.},

It gradually expanded, until 2015 when it increased in size from 45 datasets to 85 datasets. In October 2018 more datasets were added, bringing the total to 128. The new archive contains a wide range of problems, including variable length series, but it still only contains univariate time series classification problems. One of the motivations for introducing the archive was to encourage researchers to perform a more rigorous evaluation of newly proposed time series classification (TSC) algorithms. It has worked: most recent research into TSC uses all 85 datasets to evaluate algorithmic advances. Research into multivariate time series classification, where more than one series are associated with each class label, is in a position where univariate TSC research was a decade ago. Algorithms are evaluated using very few datasets and claims of improvement are not based on statistical comparisons. We aim to address this problem by forming the first iteration of the MTSC archive, to be hosted at the website www.timeseriesclassification.com. Like the univariate archive, this formulation was a collaborative effort between researchers at the University of East Anglia (UEA) and the University of California, Riverside (UCR). The 2018 vintage consists of 30 datasets with a wide range of cases, dimensions and series lengths. For this first iteration of the archive we format all data to be of equal length, include no series with missing data and provide train/test splits.},

We postulate that fine temporal detail, e.g., whether a series of blood tests are completed at once or in rapid succession should not alter predictions based on this data. Motivated by this intuition, we propose models for analyzing sequences of multivariate clinical time series data that are invariant to this temporal clustering. We propose an efficient data augmentation technique that exploits the postulated temporal-clustering invariance to regularize deep neural networks optimized for several clinical prediction tasks. We introduce two techniques to temporally coarsen (downsample) irregular time series: (i) grouping the data points based on regularly-spaced timestamps; and (ii) clustering them, yielding irregularly-paced timestamps. Moreover, we propose a MultiResolution Ensemble (MRE) model, improving predictive accuracy by ensembling predictions based on inputs sequences transformed by different coarsening operators. Our experiments show that MRE improves the mAP on the benchmark mortality prediction task from 51.53\% to 53.92\%.},

Unfortunately, this guarantee fails in settings, such as generative adversarial nets, where there are multiple interacting losses. The behavior of gradient-based methods in games is not well understood \textendash{} and is becoming increasingly important as adversarial and multiobjective architectures proliferate. In this paper, we develop new techniques to understand and control the dynamics in general games. The key result is to decompose the second-order dynamics into two components. The first is related to potential games, which reduce to gradient descent on an implicit function; the second relates to Hamiltonian games, a new class of games that obey a conservation law, akin to conservation laws in classical mechanical systems. The decomposition motivates Symplectic Gradient Adjustment (SGA), a new algorithm for finding stable fixed points in general games. Basic experiments show SGA is competitive with recently proposed algorithms for finding stable fixed points in GANs \textendash{} whilst at the same time being applicable to \textendash{} and having guarantees in \textendash{} much more general games.},

NDT is an architecture a la decision tree where each splitting node is an independent multilayer perceptron allowing oblique decision functions or arbritrary nonlinear decision function if more than one layer is used. This way, each MLP can be seen as a node of the tree. We then show that with the weight sharing asumption among those units, we end up with a Hashing Neural Network (HNN) which is a multilayer perceptron with sigmoid activation function for the last layer as opposed to the standard softmax. The output units then jointly represent the probability to be in a particular region. The proposed framework allows for global optimization as opposed to greedy in DT and differentiability w.r.t. all parameters and the input, allowing easy integration in any learnable pipeline, for example after CNNs for computer vision tasks. We also demonstrate the modeling power of HNN allowing to learn union of disjoint regions for final clustering or classification making it more general and powerful than standard softmax MLP requiring linear separability thus reducing the need on the inner layer to perform complex data transformations. We finally show experiments for supervised, semi-suppervised and unsupervised tasks and compare results with standard DTs and MLPs.},

  abstract = {Generating accurate and reliable sales forecasts is crucial in the E-commerce business. The current state-of-the-art techniques are typically univariate methods, which produce forecasts considering only the historical sales data of a single product. However, in a situation where large quantities of related time series are available, conditioning the forecast of an individual time series on past behaviour of similar, related time series can be beneficial. Since the product assortment hierarchy in an E-commerce platform contains large numbers of related products, in which the sales demand patterns can be correlated, our attempt is to incorporate this cross-series information in a unified model. We achieve this by globally training a Long Short-Term Memory network (LSTM) that exploits the non-linear demand relationships available in an E-commerce product assortment hierarchy. Aside from the forecasting framework, we also propose a systematic pre-processing framework to overcome the challenges in the E-commerce business. We also introduce several product grouping strategies to supplement the LSTM learning schemes, in situations where sales patterns in a product portfolio are disparate. We empirically evaluate the proposed forecasting framework on a real-world online marketplace dataset from Walmart.com. Our method achieves competitive results on category level and super-departmental level datasets, outperforming state-of-the-art techniques.},

  abstract = {Conformal prediction is a popular, modern technique for providing valid predictive inference for arbitrary machine learning models. Its validity relies on the assumptions of exchangeability of the data, and symmetry of the given model fitting algorithm as a function of the data. However, exchangeability is often violated when predictive models are deployed in practice. For example, if the data distribution drifts over time, then the data points are no longer exchangeable; moreover, in such settings, we might want to use a nonsymmetric algorithm that treats recent observations as more relevant. This paper generalizes conformal prediction to deal with both aspects: we employ weighted quantiles to introduce robustness against distribution drift, and design a new randomization technique to allow for algorithms that do not treat data points symmetrically. Our new methods are provably robust, with substantially less loss of coverage when exchangeability is violated due to distribution drift or other challenging features of real data, while also achieving the same coverage guarantees as existing conformal prediction methods if the data points are in fact exchangeable. We demonstrate the practical utility of these new tools with simulations and real-data experiments on electricity and election forecasting.},

Specifically, we consider the case in which the autocorrelation of the factors is explicitly accounted for and therefore the factor model has a state-space form. Estimation of the factors and their loadings is implemented by means of the Expectation Maximization algorithm, jointly with the Kalman smoother. We prove that, as both the dimension of the panel \$n\$ and the sample size \$T\$ diverge to infinity, the estimated loadings, factors, and common components are \$\textbackslash min(\textbackslash sqrt n,\textbackslash sqrt T)\$-consistent and asymptotically normal. Although the model is estimated under the unrealistic constraint of independent idiosyncratic errors, this mis-specification does not affect consistency. Moreover, we give conditions under which the derived asymptotic distribution can still be used for inference even in case of mis-specifications. Our results are confirmed by a MonteCarlo simulation exercise where we compare the performance of our estimators with Principal Components.},

We focus on text classifiers and make them more interpretable by having them provide a justification, a rationale, for their predictions. We approach this problem by jointly training two neural network models: a latent model that selects a rationale (i.e. a short and informative part of the input text), and a classifier that learns from the words in the rationale alone. Previous work proposed to assign binary latent masks to input positions and to promote short selections via sparsity-inducing penalties such as L0 regularisation. We propose a latent model that mixes discrete and continuous behaviour allowing at the same time for binary selections and gradient-based training without REINFORCE. In our formulation, we can tractably compute the expected value of penalties such as L0, which allows us to directly optimise the model towards a pre-specified text selection rate. We show that our approach is competitive with previous work on rationale extraction, and explore further uses in attention mechanisms.},

Motivated by the desire to develop learning algorithms that can generalize when learning highly varying functions such as those presumably needed to achieve artificial intelligence, we study some theoretical limitations of decision trees. We demonstrate formally that they can be seriously hurt by the curse of dimensionality in a sense that is a bit different from other nonparametric statistical methods, but most importantly, that they cannot generalize to variations not seen in the training set. This is because a decision tree creates a partition of the input space and needs at least one example in each of the regions associated with a leaf to make a sensible prediction in that region. A better understanding of the fundamental reasons for this limitation suggests that one should use forests or even deeper architectures instead of trees, which provide a form of distributed representation and can generalize to variations not encountered in the training data.},

  abstract = {Deep learning algorithms seek to exploit the unknown structure in the input distribution in order to discover good representations, often at multiple levels, with higher-level learned features defined in terms of lower-level features. The objective is to make these higherlevel representations more abstract, with their individual features more invariant to most of the variations that are typically present in the training distribution, while collectively preserving as much as possible of the information in the input. Ideally, we would like these representations to disentangle the unknown factors of variation that underlie the training distribution. Such unsupervised learning of representations can be exploited usefully under the hypothesis that the input distribution P (x) is structurally related to some task of interest, say predicting P (y|x). This paper focuses on the context of the Unsupervised and Transfer Learning Challenge, on why unsupervised pre-training of representations can be useful, and how it can be exploited in the transfer learning scenario, where we care about predictions on examples that are not from the same distribution as the training distribution.},

We used separate models for each hourly period, with component-wise gradient boosting for estimating each model using univariate penalised regression splines as base learners. The models allow for the electricity demand changing with the time-of-year, day-of-week, time-of-day, and on public holidays, with the main predictors being current and past temperatures, and past demand.

However, it is particularly challenging to forecast these hierarchical structures. In fact, it requires not only good forecast accuracy at each level of the hierarchy, but also the coherency between di\dbend erent levels, i.e. the forecasts should satisfy the hierarchical aggregation constraints. Given some incoherent base forecasts, the state-of-the-art methods compute revised forecasts based on forecast combination which ensures that the aggregation constraints are satis\dbend ed. However, these methods assume the base forecasts are unbiased and constrain the revised forecasts to be also unbiased. We propose a new forecasting method which relaxes these unbiasedness conditions, and seeks the revised forecasts with the best tradeo\dbend{} between bias and forecast variance. We also present a regularization method which allows us to deal with high-dimensional hierarchies, and provide its theoretical justi\dbend cation. Finally, we compare the proposed method with the state-of-the-art methods both theoretically and empirically. The results on both simulated and real-world data indicate that our methods provide competitive results compared to the state-of-the-art methods.},

Several approaches that deal with this complex problem have been proposed in the literature but an extensive comparison on a large number of tasks is still missing. This paper aims to fill this gap by reviewing existing strategies for multi-step ahead forecasting and comparing them in theoretical and practical terms. To attain such an objective, we performed a large scale comparison of these different strategies using a large experimental benchmark (namely the 111 series from the NN5 forecasting competition). In addition, we considered the effects of deseasonalization, input variable selection, and forecast combination on these strategies and on multi-step ahead forecasting at large. The following three findings appear to be consistently supported by the experimental results: Multiple-Output strategies are the best performing approaches, deseasonalization leads to uniformly improved forecast accuracy, and input selection is more effective when performed in conjunction with deseasonalization.},

  abstract = {In time series predictor evaluation, we observe that with respect to the model selection procedure there is a gap between evaluation of traditional forecasting procedures, on the one hand, and evaluation of machine learning techniques on the other hand. In traditional forecasting, it is common practice to reserve a part from the end of each time series for testing, and to use the rest of the series for training. Thus it is not made full use of the data, but theoretical problems with respect to temporal evolutionary effects and dependencies within the data as well as practical problems regarding missing values are eliminated. On the other hand, when evaluating machine learning and other regression methods used for time series forecasting, often cross-validation is used for evaluation, paying little attention to the fact that those theoretical problems invalidate the fundamental assumptions of cross-validation. To close this gap and examine the consequences of different model selection procedures in practice, we have developed a rigorous and extensive empirical study. Six different model selection procedures, based on (i) cross-validation and (ii) evaluation using the series' last part, are used to assess the performance of four machine learning and other regression techniques on synthetic and real-world time series. No practical consequences of the theoretical flaws were found during our study, but the use of crossvalidation techniques led to a more robust model selection. To make use of the ``best of both worlds'', we suggest that the use of a blocked form of cross-validation for time series evaluation became the standard procedure, thus using all available information and circumventing the theoretical problems.},

  abstract = {The reconstruction from observations of high-dimensional chaotic dynamics such as geophysical flows is hampered by (i) the partial and noisy observations that can realistically be obtained, (ii) the need to learn from long time series of data, and (iii) the unstable nature of the dynamics. To achieve such inference from the observations over long time series, it has been suggested to combine data assimilation and machine learning in several ways. We show how to unify these approaches from a Bayesian perspective using expectation-maximization and coordinate descents. Implementations and approximations of these methods are also discussed. Finally, we numerically and successfully test the approach on two relevant low-order chaotic models with distinct identifiability.},

In this paper, we discuss data challenges and solutions in the context of a Neural Forecasting application on labor planning.We discuss how to make this forecasting system resilient to these data challenges. We address changes in data distribution with a periodic retraining scheme and discuss the critical importance of model stability in this setting. Furthermore, we show how our deep learning model deals with missing values natively without requiring imputation. Finally, we describe how we detect anomalies in the input data and mitigate their effect before they impact the forecasts.

It leverages the theory of optimal transport, and in particular the definition of Wasserstein barycenters, to introduce for the first time the notion of barycentric coordinates for histograms. These coordinates take into account the underlying geometry of the ground space on which the histograms are defined, and are thus particularly meaningful for applications in graphics to shapes, color or material modification. Beside this abstract construction, we propose a fast numerical optimization scheme to solve this backward problem (finding the barycentric coordinates of a given histogram) with a low computational overhead with respect to the forward problem (computing the barycenter). This scheme relies on a backward algorithmic differentiation of the Sinkhorn algorithm which is used to optimize the entropic regularization of Wasserstein barycenters. We showcase an illustrative set of applications of these Wasserstein coordinates to various problems in computer graphics: shape approximation, BRDF acquisition and color editing.},

The proposed network contains stacks of dilated convolutions that allow it to access a broad range of historical data when forecasting. It also uses a rectified linear unit (ReLU) activation function, and conditioning is performed by applying multiple convolutional filters in parallel to separate time series, which allows for the fast processing of data and the exploitation of the correlation structure between the multivariate time series. We test and analyze the performance of the convolutional network both unconditionally and conditionally for financial time series forecasting using the Standard \& Poor's 500 index, the volatility index, the Chicago Board Options Exchange interest rate and several exchange rates, and we extensively compare its performance with those of the well-known autoregressive model and a long short-term memory network. We show that a convolutional network is well suited to regression-type problems and is able to effectively learn dependencies in and between the series without the need for long historical time series, that it is a time-efficient and easy-to-implement alternative to recurrent-type networks, and that it tends to outperform linear and recurrent models.},

If the parameters are known exactly, this random sequence can be computed directly from the observations; when this calculation is made with estimates substituted for the true parameter values, the resulting sequence is referred to as the "residuals," which can be regarded as estimates of the errors. If the appropriate model has been chosen, there will be zero autocorrelation in the errors. In checking adequacy of fit it is therefore logical to study the sample autocorrelation function of the residuals. For large samples the residuals from a correctly fitted model resemble very closely the true errors of the process; however, care is needed in interpreting the serial correlations of the residuals. It is shown here that the residual autocorrelations are to a close approximation representable as a singular linear transformation of the autocorrelations of the errors so that they possess a singular normal distribution. Failing to allow for this results in a tendency to overlook evidence of lack of fit. Tests of fit and diagnostic checks are devised which take these facts into account.]},

  abstract = {For practical reasons, many forecasts of case, hospitalization, and death counts in the context of the current Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic are issued in the form of central predictive intervals at various levels. This is also the case for the forecasts collected in the COVID-19 Forecast Hub (https://covid19forecasthub.org/). Forecast evaluation metrics like the logarithmic score, which has been applied in several infectious disease forecasting challenges, are then not available as they require full predictive distributions. This article provides an overview of how established methods for the evaluation of quantile and interval forecasts can be applied to epidemic forecasts in this format. Specifically, we discuss the computation and interpretation of the weighted interval score, which is a proper score that approximates the continuous ranked probability score. It can be interpreted as a generalization of the absolute error to probabilistic forecasts and allows for a decomposition into a measure of sharpness and penalties for over- and underprediction., During the COVID-19 pandemic, model-based probabilistic forecasts of case, hospitalization, and death numbers can help to improve situational awareness and guide public health interventions. The COVID-19 Forecast Hub (https://covid19forecasthub.org/) collects such forecasts from numerous national and international groups. Systematic and statistically sound evaluation of forecasts is an important prerequisite to revise and improve models and to combine different forecasts into ensemble predictions. We provide an intuitive introduction to scoring methods, which are suitable for the interval/quantile-based format used in the Forecast Hub, and compare them to other commonly used performance measures.},

These subpopulations are built according to location, to exogenous information and/or to profiles we determined from historical households consumption time series. Thus, we aim to forecast the electricity consumption time series at several levels of households aggregation. These time series are linked through some summation constraints which induce a hierarchy. Our approach consists in three steps: feature generation, aggregation and projection. Firstly (feature generation step), we build, for each considering group for households, a benchmark forecast (called features), using random forests or generalized additive models. Secondly (aggregation step), aggregation algorithms, run in parallel, aggregate these forecasts and provide new predictions. Finally (projection step), we use the summation constraints induced by the time series underlying hierarchy to re-conciliate the forecasts by projecting them in a well-chosen linear subspace. We provide some theoretical guaranties on the average prediction error of this methodology, through the minimization of a quantity called regret. We also test our approach on households power consumption data collected in Great Britain by multiple energy providers in the Energy Demand Research Project context.

Leveraging learning experience with similar datasets is a well-established technique for classification problems called few-shot classification. However, existing approaches cannot be applied to time-series forecasting because i) multivariate time-series datasets have different channels and ii) forecasting is principally different from classification. In this paper we formalize the problem of few-shot forecasting of time-series with heterogeneous channels for the first time. Extending recent work on heterogeneous attributes in vector data, we develop a model composed of permutation-invariant deep set-blocks which incorporate a temporal embedding. We assemble the first meta-dataset of 40 multivariate time-series datasets and show through experiments that our model provides a good generalization, outperforming baselines carried over from simpler scenarios that either fail to learn across tasks or miss temporal information.},

This is the balance between staying with the option that gave highest payoffs in the past and exploring new options that might give higher payoffs in the future. Although the study of bandit problems dates back to the 1930s, exploration\textendash exploitation trade-offs arise in several modern applications, such as ad placement, website optimization, and packet routing. Mathematically, a multi-armed bandit is defined by the payoff process associated with each option. In this monograph, we focus on two extreme cases in which the analysis of regret is particularly simple and elegant: i.i.d. payoffs and adversarial payoffs. Besides the basic setting of finitely many actions, we also analyze some of the most important variants and extensions, such as the contextual bandit model.},

While many algorithms for change point detection exist, little attention has been paid to evaluating their performance on real-world time series. Algorithms are typically evaluated on simulated data and a small number of commonly-used series with unreliable ground truth. Clearly this does not provide sufficient insight into the comparative performance of these algorithms. Therefore, instead of developing yet another change point detection method, we consider it vastly more important to properly evaluate existing algorithms on real-world data. To achieve this, we present the first data set specifically designed for the evaluation of change point detection algorithms, consisting of 37 time series from various domains. Each time series was annotated by five expert human annotators to provide ground truth on the presence and location of change points. We analyze the consistency of the human annotators, and describe evaluation metrics that can be used to measure algorithm performance in the presence of multiple ground truth annotations. Subsequently, we present a benchmark study where 13 existing algorithms are evaluated on each of the time series in the data set. This study shows that binary segmentation (Scott and Knott, 1974) and Bayesian online change point detection (Adams and MacKay, 2007) are among the best performing methods. Our aim is that this data set will serve as a proving ground in the development of novel change point detection algorithms.},

  abstract = {The ability to decompose scenes in terms of abstract building blocks is crucial for general intelligence. Where those basic building blocks share meaningful properties, interactions and other regularities across scenes, such decompositions can simplify reasoning and facilitate imagination of novel scenarios. In particular, representing perceptual observations in terms of entities should improve data efficiency and transfer performance on a wide range of tasks. Thus we need models capable of discovering useful decompositions of scenes by identifying units with such regularities and representing them in a common format. To address this problem, we have developed the Multi-Object Network (MONet). In this model, a VAE is trained end-to-end together with a recurrent attention network \textendash{} in a purely unsupervised manner \textendash{} to provide attention masks around, and reconstructions of, regions of images. We show that this model is capable of learning to decompose and represent challenging 3D scenes into semantically meaningful components, such as objects and background elements.},

However, since the (metric) space of persistence diagrams is not Hilbert, they end up being difficult inputs for most Machine Learning techniques. To address this concern, several vectorization methods have been put forward that embed persistence diagrams into either finite-dimensional Euclidean space or (implicit) infinite dimensional Hilbert space with kernels. In this work, we focus on persistence diagrams built on top of graphs. Relying on extended persistence theory and the so-called heat kernel signature, we show how graphs can be encoded by (extended) persistence diagrams in a provably stable way. We then propose a general and versatile framework for learning vectorizations of persistence diagrams, which encompasses most of the vectorization techniques used in the literature. We finally showcase the experimental strength of our setup by achieving competitive scores on classification tasks on real-life graph datasets.},

This strategy breaks down when the number of categories grows, as it creates high-dimensional feature vectors. Additionally, for string entries, one-hot encoding does not capture information in their representation.Here, we seek low-dimensional encoding of high-cardinality string categorical variables. Ideally, these should be: scalable to many categories; interpretable to end users; and facilitate statistical analysis. We introduce two encoding approaches for string categories: a Gamma-Poisson matrix factorization on substring counts, and the min-hash encoder, for fast approximation of string similarities. We show that min-hash turns set inclusions into inequality relations that are easier to learn. Both approaches are scalable and streamable. Experiments on real and simulated data show that these methods improve supervised learning with high-cardinality categorical variables. We recommend the following: if scalability is central, the min-hash encoder is the best option as it does not require any data fit; if interpretability is important, the Gamma-Poisson factorization is the best alternative, as it can be interpreted as one-hot encoding on inferred categories with informative feature names. Both models enable autoML on the original string entries as they remove the need for feature engineering or data cleaning.},

Nonparametric classification and regression techniques, such as decision trees and neural networks, have frequentist (classification and regression trees (CART) and artificial neural networks) as well as Bayesian (Bayesian CART and Bayesian neural networks) approaches to learning from data. In this work, we present two hybrid models combining the Bayesian and frequentist versions of CART and neural networks, which we call the Bayesian neural tree (BNT) models. Both models exploit the architecture of decision trees and have lesser number of parameters to tune than advanced neural networks. Such models can simultaneously perform feature selection and prediction, are highly flexible, and generalize well in settings with a limited number of training observations. We study the consistency of the proposed models, and derive the optimal value of an important model parameter. We also provide illustrative examples using a wide variety of real-life regression data sets.},

Two common challenges afflicting long-horizon forecasting are the volatility of the predictions and their computational complexity. In this paper, we introduce N-HiTS, a model which addresses both challenges by incorporating novel hierarchical interpolation and multi-rate data sampling techniques. These techniques enable the proposed method to assemble its predictions sequentially, selectively emphasizing components with different frequencies and scales, while decomposing the input signal and synthesizing the forecast. We conduct an extensive empirical evaluation demonstrating the advantages of N-HiTS over the state-of-the-art long-horizon forecasting methods. On an array of multivariate forecasting tasks, the proposed method provides an average accuracy improvement of 25\% over the latest Transformer architectures while reducing the computation time by an order of magnitude.

  abstract = {Multivariate time series forecasting is extensively studied throughout the years with ubiquitous applications in areas such as finance, traffic, environment, etc. Still, concerns have been raised on traditional methods for incapable of modeling complex patterns or dependencies lying in real word data. To address such concerns, various deep learning models, mainly Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) based methods, are proposed. Nevertheless, capturing extremely long-term patterns while effectively incorporating information from other variables remains a challenge for time-series forecasting. Furthermore, lack-of-explainability remains one serious drawback for deep neural network models. Inspired by Memory Network proposed for solving the question-answering task, we propose a deep learning based model named Memory Timeseries network (MTNet) for time series forecasting. MTNet consists of a large memory component, three separate encoders, and an autoregressive component to train jointly. Addtionally, the attention mechanism designed enable MTNet to be highly interpretable. We can easily tell which part of the historic data is referenced the most.},

In time series prediction and other related tasks, it has been noted that missing values and their missing patterns are often correlated with the target labels, a.k.a., informative missingness. There is very limited work on exploiting the missing patterns for effective imputation and improving prediction performance. In this paper, we develop novel deep learning models, namely GRU-D, as one of the early attempts. GRU-D is based on Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), a state-of-the-art recurrent neural network. It takes two representations of missing patterns, i.e., masking and time interval, and effectively incorporates them into a deep model architecture so that it not only captures the long-term temporal dependencies in time series, but also utilizes the missing patterns to achieve better prediction results. Experiments of time series classification tasks on real-world clinical datasets (MIMIC-III, PhysioNet) and synthetic datasets demonstrate that our models achieve state-of-the-art performance and provide useful insights for better understanding and utilization of missing values in time series analysis.},

Borrowing ideas from symbolic data analysis, we consider data representations beyond scalars and vectors. Specifically, we consider a quantile function as an observation, and develop a new class of dynamic models for quantile-function-valued (QF-valued) time series. In order to make statistical inferences and account for parameter uncertainty, we propose a method whereby a likelihood function can be constructed for QF-valued data, and develop an adaptive MCMC sampling algorithm for simulating from the posterior distribution. Compared to modelling realised measures, modelling the entire quantile functions of intra-daily returns allows one to gain more insight into the dynamic structure of price movements. Via simulations, we show that the proposed MCMC algorithm is effective in recovering the posterior distribution, and that the posterior means are reasonable point estimates of the model parameters. For empirical studies, the new model is applied to analysing one-minute returns of major international stock indices. Through quantile scaling, we further demonstrate the usefulness of our method by forecasting one-step-ahead the Value-at-Risk of daily returns.},

The conventional approach for training predictors does not directly consider temporal consistency, and often produces undesirable jitter. Although post-hoc smoothing (e.g., via a Kalman filter) can mitigate this issue to some degree, it is not ideal due to overly stringent modeling assumptions (e.g., Gaussian noise). We propose a recurrent decision tree framework that can directly incorporate temporal consistency into a data-driven predictor, as well as a learning algorithm that can efficiently learn such temporally smooth models. Our approach does not require any post-processing, making online smooth predictions much easier to generate when the noise model is unknown. We apply our approach to sports broadcasting: given noisy player detections, we learn where the camera should look based on human demonstrations. Our experiments exhibit significant improvements over conventional baselines and showcase the practicality of our approach.},

  abstract = {We present a probabilistic forecasting framework based on convolutional neural network for multiple related time series forecasting. The framework can be applied to estimate probability density under both parametric and non-parametric settings. More specifically, stacked residual blocks based on dilated causal convolutional nets are constructed to capture the temporal dependencies of the series. Combined with representation learning, our approach is able to learn complex patterns such as seasonality, holiday effects within and across series, and to leverage those patterns for more accurate forecasts, especially when historical data is sparse or unavailable. Extensive empirical studies are performed on several real-world datasets, including datasets from JD.com, China's largest online retailer. The results show that our framework outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in both accuracy and efficiency.},

  abstract = {Although adversarial examples and model robustness have been extensively studied in the context of linear models and neural networks, research on this issue in tree-based models and how to make tree-based models robust against adversarial examples is still limited. In this paper, we show that tree based models are also vulnerable to adversarial examples and develop a novel algorithm to learn robust trees. At its core, our method aims to optimize the performance under the worstcase perturbation of input features, which leads to a max-min saddle point problem. Incorporating this saddle point objective into the decision tree building procedure is non-trivial due to the discrete nature of trees\textemdash a naive approach to finding the best split according to this saddle point objective will take exponential time. To make our approach practical and scalable, we propose efficient tree building algorithms by approximating the inner minimizer in this saddle point problem, and present efficient implementations for classical information gain based trees as well as state-of-the-art tree boosting models such as XGBoost. Experimental results on real world datasets demonstrate that the proposed algorithms can substantially improve the robustness of tree-based models against adversarial examples.},

As data volumes keep growing, it has become customary to train large neural networks with hundreds of millions of parameters to maintain enough capacity to memorize these volumes and obtain state-of-the-art accuracy. To get around the costly computations associated with large models and data, the community is increasingly investing in specialized hardware for model training. However, specialized hardware is expensive and hard to generalize to a multitude of tasks. The progress on the algorithmic front has failed to demonstrate a direct advantage over powerful hardware such as NVIDIA-V100 GPUs. This paper provides an exception. We propose SLIDE (Sub-LInear Deep learning Engine) that uniquely blends smart randomized algorithms, with multi-core parallelism and workload optimization. Using just a CPU, SLIDE drastically reduces the computations during both training and inference outperforming an optimized implementation of Tensorflow (TF) on the best available GPU. Our evaluations on industry-scale recommendation datasets, with large fully connected architectures, show that training with SLIDE on a 44 core CPU is more than 3.5 times (1 hour vs. 3.5 hours) faster than the same network trained using TF on Tesla V100 at any given accuracy level. On the same CPU hardware, SLIDE is over 10x faster than TF. We provide codes and scripts for reproducibility.},

  abstract = {As a common strategy in sales-supply chains, the prediction of sales volume offers precious information for companies to achieve a healthy balance between supply and demand. In practice, the sales prediction task is formulated as a time series prediction problem which aims to predict the future sales volume for different products with the observation of various influential factors (e.g., brand, season, discount, etc.) and corresponding historical sales records. However, with the development of contemporary commercial markets, the dynamic interaction between influential factors with different semantic meanings becomes more subtle, causing challenges in fully capturing dependencies among these variables. Besides, though seeking similar trends from the history benefits the accuracy for the prediction of upcoming sales, existing methods hardly suit sales prediction tasks because the trends in sales time series are more irregular and complex. Hence, we gain insights from the encoder-decoder recurrent neural network (RNN) structure, and propose a novel framework named TADA to carry out trend alignment with dualattention, multi-task RNNs for sales prediction. In TADA, we innovatively divide the influential factors into internal feature and external feature, which are jointly modelled by a multi-task RNN encoder. In the decoding stage, TADA utilizes two attention mechanisms to compensate for the unknown states of influential factors in the future and adaptively align the upcoming trend with relevant historical trends to ensure precise sales prediction. Experimental results on two real-world datasets comprehensively show the superiority of TADA in sales prediction tasks against other state-of-the-art competitors.},

  abstract = {Reinforcement learning algorithms are typically designed to learn a performant policy that can repeatedly and autonomously complete a task, usually starting from scratch. However, in many real-world situations, the goal might not be to learn a policy that can do the task repeatedly, but simply to perform a new task successfully once in a single trial. For example, imagine a disaster relief robot tasked with retrieving an item from a fallen building, where it cannot get direct supervision from humans. It must retrieve this object within one test-time trial, and must do so while tackling unknown obstacles, though it may leverage knowledge it has of the building before the disaster. We formalize this problem setting, which we call single-life reinforcement learning (SLRL), where an agent must complete a task within a single episode without interventions, utilizing its prior experience while contending with some form of novelty. SLRL provides a natural setting to study the challenge of autonomously adapting to unfamiliar situations, and we find that algorithms designed for standard episodic reinforcement learning often struggle to recover from out-of-distribution states in this setting. Motivated by this observation, we propose an algorithm, \$Q\$-weighted adversarial learning (QWALE), which employs a distribution matching strategy that leverages the agent's prior experience as guidance in novel situations. Our experiments on several single-life continuous control problems indicate that methods based on our distribution matching formulation are 20-60\% more successful because they can more quickly recover from novel states.},

This presents a computational bottleneck in statistical manifold learning when observations of probability distributions rather than vector-valued variables are available or when data size is large. We resolve this problem by proposing a new method for approximation in statistical manifold learning. The novelty of our approximation is the strongly consistent distance estimators based on independent and identically distributed samples from probability distributions. By exploiting the connection between Hellinger/total variation distance for discrete distributions and the L2/L1 norm, we demonstrate that the proposed distance estimators, combined with approximate nearest neighbor searching, could largely improve the computational efficiency with little to no loss in the accuracy of manifold embedding. The result is robust to different manifold learning algorithms and different approximate nearest neighbor algorithms. The proposed method is applied to learning statistical manifolds of electricity usage. This application demonstrates how underlying structures in high dimensional data, including anomalies, can be visualized and identified, in a way that is scalable to large datasets.},

Motivated by ensemble methods in general, and boosting algorithms in particular, BART is defined by a statistical model: a prior and a likelihood. This approach enables full posterior inference including point and interval estimates of the unknown regression function as well as the marginal effects of potential predictors. By keeping track of predictor inclusion frequencies, BART can also be used for model free variable selection. BART's many features are illustrated with a bake-off against competing methods on 42 different data sets, with a simulation experiment and on a drug discovery classification problem.},

Such an alternative is provided by a treed model which uses a binary tree to identify such a partition. However, treed models go further than conventional trees (e.g. CART, C4.5) by fitting models rather than a simple mean or proportion within each subset. In this paper, we propose a Bayesian approach for finding and fitting parametric treed models, in particular focusing on Bayesian treed regression. The potential of this approach is illustrated by a cross-validation comparison of predictive performance with neural nets, MARS, and conventional trees on simulated and real data sets.},

We find that instruction finetuning with the above aspects dramatically improves performance on a variety of model classes (PaLM, T5, U-PaLM), prompting setups (zero-shot, few-shot, CoT), and evaluation benchmarks (MMLU, BBH, TyDiQA, MGSM, open-ended generation). For instance, Flan-PaLM 540B instruction-finetuned on 1.8K tasks outperforms PALM 540B by a large margin (+9.4\% on average). Flan-PaLM 540B achieves state-of-the-art performance on several benchmarks, such as 75.2\% on five-shot MMLU. We also publicly release Flan-T5 checkpoints, which achieve strong few-shot performance even compared to much larger models, such as PaLM 62B. Overall, instruction finetuning is a general method for improving the performance and usability of pretrained language models.},

Meanwhile, as part of the continued digitization of industrial processes, various sensor technologies are deployed that enable us to record time-varying attributes (a.k.a., time series) of such entities, thus producing correlated time series. To enable accurate forecasting on such correlated time series, this paper proposes two models that combine convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs). The first model employs a CNN on each individual time series, combines the convoluted features, and then applies an RNN on top of the convoluted features in the end to enable forecasting. The second model adds additional auto-encoders into the individual CNNs, making the second model a multi-task learning model, which provides accurate and robust forecasting. Experiments on a large real-world correlated time series data set suggest that the proposed two models are effective and outperform baselines in most settings.},

  abstract = {Linear dimensionality reduction methods are commonly used to extract low-dimensional structure from high-dimensional data. However, popular methods disregard temporal structure, rendering them prone to extracting noise rather than meaningful dynamics when applied to time series data. At the same time, many successful unsupervised learning methods for temporal, sequential and spatial data extract features which are predictive of their surrounding context. Combining these approaches, we introduce Dynamical Components Analysis (DCA), a linear dimensionality reduction method which discovers a subspace of high-dimensional time series data with maximal predictive information, defined as the mutual information between the past and future. We test DCA on synthetic examples and demonstrate its superior ability to extract dynamical structure compared to commonly used linear methods. We also apply DCA to several real-world datasets, showing that the dimensions extracted by DCA are more useful than those extracted by other methods for predicting future states and decoding auxiliary variables. Overall, DCA robustly extracts dynamical structure in noisy, high-dimensional data while retaining the computational efficiency and geometric interpretability of linear dimensionality reduction methods.},

To validate the effectiveness of BNNs we conduct two sets of experiments on the Torch7 and Theano frameworks. On both, BNNs achieved nearly state-of-the-art results over the MNIST, CIFAR-10 and SVHN datasets. Last but not least, we wrote a binary matrix multiplication GPU kernel with which it is possible to run our MNIST BNN 7 times faster than with an unoptimized GPU kernel, without suffering any loss in classification accuracy.

  abstract = {Domain adaptation is one of the most challenging tasks of modern data analytics. If the adaptation is done correctly, models built on a specific data representation become more robust when confronted to data depicting the same classes, but described by another observation system. Among the many strategies proposed, finding domain-invariant representations has shown excellent properties, in particular since it allows to train a unique classifier effective in all domains. In this paper, we propose a regularized unsupervised optimal transportation model to perform the alignment of the representations in the source and target domains. We learn a transportation plan matching both PDFs, which constrains labeled samples of the same class in the source domain to remain close during transport. This way, we exploit at the same time the labeled samples in the source and the distributions observed in both domains. Experiments on toy and challenging real visual adaptation examples show the interest of the method, that consistently outperforms state of the art approaches. In addition, numerical experiments show that our approach leads to better performances on domain invariant deep learning features and can be easily adapted to the semi-supervised case where few labeled samples are available in the target domain.},

  abstract = {Short-term traffic forecasting based on deep learning methods, especially long short-term memory (LSTM) neural networks, has received much attention in recent years. However, the potential of deep learning methods in traffic forecasting has not yet fully been exploited in terms of the depth of the model architecture, the spatial scale of the prediction area, and the predictive power of spatial-temporal data. In this paper, a deep stacked bidirectional and unidirectional LSTM (SBU- LSTM) neural network architecture is proposed, which considers both forward and backward dependencies in time series data, to predict network-wide traffic speed. A bidirectional LSTM (BDLSM) layer is exploited to capture spatial features and bidirectional temporal dependencies from historical data. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that BDLSTMs have been applied as building blocks for a deep architecture model to measure the backward dependency of traffic data for prediction. The proposed model can handle missing values in input data by using a masking mechanism. Further, this scalable model can predict traffic speed for both freeway and complex urban traffic networks. Comparisons with other classical and state-of-the-art models indicate that the proposed SBU-LSTM neural network achieves superior prediction performance for the whole traffic network in both accuracy and robustness.},

  abstract = {In reinforcement learning an agent interacts with the environment by taking actions and observing the next state and reward. When sampled probabilistically, these state transitions, rewards, and actions can all induce randomness in the observed long-term return. Traditionally, reinforcement learning algorithms average over this randomness to estimate the value function. In this paper, we build on recent work advocating a distributional approach to reinforcement learning in which the distribution over returns is modeled explicitly instead of only estimating the mean. That is, we examine methods of learning the value distribution instead of the value function. We give results that close a number of gaps between the theoretical and algorithmic results given by Bellemare, Dabney, and Munos (2017). First, we extend existing results to the approximate distribution setting. Second, we present a novel distributional reinforcement learning algorithm consistent with our theoretical formulation. Finally, we evaluate this new algorithm on the Atari 2600 games, observing that it significantly outperforms many of the recent improvements on DQN, including the related distributional algorithm C51.},

We argue that timeinvariance can reduce the capacity to perform multi-step-ahead forecasting, where modelling the dynamics at a range of scales and resolutions is required. We propose ForecastNet which uses a deep feed-forward architecture to provide a timevariant model. An additional novelty of ForecastNet is interleaved outputs, which we show assist in mitigating vanishing gradients.

The model presented provides a means for modelling and forecasting various water quality parameters. It is inspired by data dynamics and does not rely on physical ecosystem modelling. The model is constructed within the Bayesian filtering framework. The Kalman filter and the unscented Kalman filer are applied for inference. The results demonstrate generalisability to both variables and environments. The ability for short term forecasting with mean absolute percentage errors between 0.5\% and 11\% is demonstrated.},

Our method not only enables capturing longer-term dependency, but also resolves the context fragmentation problem.

In this paper, we present a probabilistic top-down approach to hierarchical forecasting that uses a novel attention-based RNN model to learn the distribution of the proportions according to which each parent prediction is split among its children nodes at any point in time. These probabilistic proportions are then coupled with an independent univariate probabilistic forecasting model (such as Prophet or STS) for the root time series. The resulting forecasts are computed in a top-down fashion and are naturally coherent, and also support probabilistic predictions over all time series in the hierarchy. We provide theoretical justification for the superiority of our top-down approach compared to traditional bottom-up hierarchical modeling. Finally, we experiment on three public datasets and demonstrate significantly improved probabilistic forecasts, compared to state-of-the-art probabilistic hierarchical models.},

Beyond expanding this valuable resource, this paper offers pragmatic advice to anyone who may wish to evaluate a new algorithm on the archive. Finally, this paper makes a novel and yet actionable claim: of the hundreds of papers that show an improvement over the standard baseline (1-Nearest Neighbor classification), a large fraction may be misattributing the reasons for their improvement.

  abstract = {This paper tackles the modelling of large, complex and multivariate time series panels in a probabilistic setting. To this extent, we present a novel approach reconciling classical state space models with deep learning methods. By augmenting state space models with normalizing flows, we mitigate imprecisions stemming from idealized assumptions in state space models. The resulting model is highly flexible while still retaining many of the attractive properties of state space models, e.g., uncertainty and observation errors are properly accounted for, inference is tractable, sampling is efficient, good generalization performance is observed, even in low data regimes. We demonstrate competitiveness against state-of-the-art deep learning methods on the tasks of forecasting real world data and handling varying levels of missing data.},

  abstract = {Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) sequentially process data by updating their state with each new data point, and have long been the de facto choice for sequence modeling tasks. However, their inherently sequential computation makes them slow to train. Feed-forward and convolutional architectures have recently been shown to achieve superior results on some sequence modeling tasks such as machine translation, with the added advantage that they concurrently process all inputs in the sequence, leading to easy parallelization and faster training times. Despite these successes, however, popular feed-forward sequence models like the Transformer fail to generalize in many simple tasks that recurrent models handle with ease, e.g. copying strings or even simple logical inference when the string or formula lengths exceed those observed at training time. We propose the Universal Transformer (UT), a parallel-in-time self-attentive recurrent sequence model which can be cast as a generalization of the Transformer model and which addresses these issues. UTs combine the parallelizability and global receptive field of feed-forward sequence models like the Transformer with the recurrent inductive bias of RNNs. We also add a dynamic per-position halting mechanism and find that it improves accuracy on several tasks. In contrast to the standard Transformer, under certain assumptions, UTs can be shown to be Turing-complete. Our experiments show that UTs outperform standard Transformers on a wide range of algorithmic and language understanding tasks, including the challenging LAMBADA language modeling task where UTs achieve a new state of the art, and machine translation where UTs achieve a 0.9 BLEU improvement over Transformers on the WMT14 En-De dataset.},

Extreme value considerations are used to derive two further new copulas: the t extreme value copula is the limiting copula of componentwise maxima of t distributed random vectors; the t lower tail copula is the limiting copula of bivariate observations from a t distribution that are conditioned to lie below some joint threshold that is progressively lowered.

Current deep learning methods e.g., Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) perform well in learning feature representations from raw data. However, most of these models can narrowly learn semantic information behind the data. In this paper, we revisit LSTM from the perspective of Semantic Web, where streaming data are represented as ontology sequences. We propose a novel semantic-based neural network (STBNet) that (i) enriches the semantics of data stream with external text, and (ii) exploits the underlying semantics with background knowledge for time series prediction. Previous models mainly rely on numerical representation of values in raw data, while the proposed STBNet model creatively integrates semantic embedding into a hybrid neural network. We develop a new attention mechanism based on similarity among semantic embedding of ontology stream, and then we combine ontology stream and numerical analysis in the deep learning model. Furthermore, we also enrich ontology stream in STBNet, where Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are incorporated in learning lexical representations of words in the text. The experiments show that STBNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods on stock price prediction.},

So far, little attention has been paid to general AutoDL frameworks for time series forecasting, despite the enormous success in applying different novel architectures to such tasks. In this paper, we propose an efficient approach for the joint optimization of neural architecture and hyperparameters of the entire data processing pipeline for time series forecasting. In contrast to common NAS search spaces, we designed a novel neural architecture search space covering various state-of-the-art architectures, allowing for an efficient macro-search over different DL approaches. To efficiently search in such a large configuration space, we use Bayesian optimization with multi-fidelity optimization. We empirically study several different budget types enabling efficient multi-fidelity optimization on different forecasting datasets. Furthermore, we compared our resulting system, dubbed Auto-PyTorch-TS, against several established baselines and show that it significantly outperforms all of them across several datasets.},

  abstract = {Probabilistic time series forecasting is crucial in many application domains such as retail, ecommerce, finance, or biology. With the increasing availability of large volumes of data, a number of neural architectures have been proposed for this problem. In particular, Transformer-based methods achieve state-of-the-art performance on real-world benchmarks. However, these methods require a large number of parameters to be learned, which imposes high memory requirements on the computational resources for training such models. To address this problem, we introduce a novel Bidirectional Temporal Convolutional Network (BiTCN), which requires an order of magnitude less parameters than a common Transformer-based approach. Our model combines two Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCNs): the first network encodes future covariates of the time series, whereas the second network encodes past observations and covariates. We jointly estimate the parameters of an output distribution via these two networks. Experiments on four real-world datasets show that our method performs on par with four state-of-the-art probabilistic forecasting methods, including a Transformer-based approach and WaveNet, on two point metrics (sMAPE, NRMSE) as well as on a set of range metrics (quantile loss percentiles) in the majority of cases. Secondly, we demonstrate that our method requires significantly less parameters than Transformer-based methods, which means the model can be trained faster with significantly lower memory requirements, which as a consequence reduces the infrastructure cost for deploying these models.},

In particular, we provide insights into the nature and mathematical derivation of the level-l conditional coherent (LlCC) point forecast reconciliation procedure for an elementary two-level hierarchy. We show that: (i) the LlCC procedure is the result of a linearly constrained minimization of a quadratic loss function, with an exogenous constraint given by the base forecast of the top level series of the hierarchy, which is not revised; and (ii) endogenous constraints may also be considered in the same framework, thereby resulting in level conditional reconciled forecasts where both the top and the bottom level time series forecasts are coherently revised. In addition, we show that the LlCC procedure (i.e., with exogenous constraints but the result also holds in the endogenous case) does not guarantee the non-negativity of the reconciled forecasts, which can be an issue in cases when non-negativity is a natural attribute of the variables that need to be forecast (e.g., sales and tourism flows). Finally, we consider two forecasting experiments to evaluate the performance of various cross-sectional forecast combination-based point forecast reconciliation procedures (vis-\`a-vis the state-of-the-art procedures) in a fair setting. In this framework, due to the crucial role played by the (possibly different) models used to compute the base forecasts, we re-interpret the combined conditional coherent reconciliation procedure (CCCH) of Hollyman et~al. (2021) as a forecast pooling approach, and show that accuracy improvements may be obtained by adopting a simple forecast averaging strategy.},

  abstract = {In order to better engage with customers, retailers rely on extensive customer and product databases which allows them to better understand customer behaviour and purchasing patterns. This has long been a challenging task as customer modelling is a multi-faceted, noisy and time-dependent problem. The most common way to tackle this problem is indirectly through task-specific supervised learning prediction problems, with relatively little literature on modelling a customer by directly simulating their future transactions. In this paper we propose a method for generating realistic sequences of baskets that a given customer is likely to purchase over a period of time. Customer embedding representations are learned using a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) which takes into account the entire sequence of transaction data. Given the customer state at a specific point in time, a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) is trained to generate a plausible basket of products for the following week. The newly generated basket is then fed back into the RNN to update the customer's state. The GAN is thus used in tandem with the RNN module in a pipeline alternating between basket generation and customer state updating steps. This allows for sampling over a distribution of a customer's future sequence of baskets, which then can be used to gain insight into how to service the customer more effectively. The methodology is empirically shown to produce baskets that appear similar to real baskets and enjoy many common properties, including frequencies of different product types, brands, and prices.

  abstract = {Recently there has been an increasing interest in developing regression models for large datasets that are both accurate and easy to interpret. Regressors that have these properties are regression trees with linear models in the leaves, but so far, the algorithms proposed for constructing them are not scalable. In this paper we propose a novel regression tree construction algorithm that is both accurate and can truly scale to very large datasets. The main idea is, for every intermediate node, to use the EM algorithm for Gaussian mixtures to find two clusters in the data and to locally transform the regression problem into a classification problem based on closeness to these clusters. Goodness of split measures, like the gini gain, can then be used to determine the split variable and the split point much like in classification tree construction. Scalability of the algorithm can be enhanced by employing scalable versions of the EM and the classification tree construction algorithms. Tests on real and artificial data show that the proposed algorithm has accuracy comparable to other linear regression tree algorithms but requires orders of magnitude less computation time for large datasets.},

Deterministic versions of SSMs (e.g. LSTMs) proved extremely successful in modeling complex time series data. Fully probabilistic SSMs, however, are often found hard to train, even for smaller problems. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel model formulation and a scalable training algorithm based on doubly stochastic variational inference and Gaussian processes. In contrast to existing work, the proposed variational approximation allows one to fully capture the latent state temporal correlations. These correlations are the key to robust training. The effectiveness of the proposed PR-SSM is evaluated on a set of real-world benchmark datasets in comparison to state-of-the-art probabilistic model learning methods. Scalability and robustness are demonstrated on a high dimensional problem.},

We found that the performance of the Naive-Bayes algorithm signi cantly improved when features were discretized using an entropy-based method. In fact, over the 16 tested datasets, the discretized version of Naive-Bayes slightly outperformed C4.5 on average. We also show that in some cases, the performance of the C4.5 induction algorithm signi cantly improved if features were discretized in advance in our experiments, the performance never signi cantly degraded, an interesting phenomenon considering the fact that C4.5 is capable of locally discretizing features.},

We then survey recent empirical papers published in ACL and TACL during 2017 and show that while our community assigns great value to experimental results, statistical significance testing is often ignored or misused.

It allows for the joint reconciliation at all forecast horizons and uses predictive distributions rather than past variation of forecast errors. Informative priors are used to assign weights to specific predictions, which makes it possible to reconcile forecasts such that they accommodate specific judgmental predictions or managerial decisions. The reconciled forecasts adhere to hierarchical constraints, which facilitates communication and supports aligned decision-making at all levels of complex hierarchical structures. An extensive forecasting study is conducted on a large collection of 13,118 time series that measure Swiss merchandise exports, grouped hierarchically by export destination and product category. We find strong evidence that in addition to producing coherent forecasts, reconciliation also leads to substantial improvements in forecast accuracy. The use of state-space methods is particularly promising for optimal decision-making under conditions with increased model uncertainty and data volatility.},

In most machine learning applications, the main focus is on the quality of the results achieved (e.g., prediction accuracy), and hence vast amounts of data are being collected, requiring significant computational resources to build models. In many scenarios, however, it is infeasible or impractical to set up large centralized data repositories. In personal health, for instance, privacy issues may inhibit the sharing of detailed personal data. In such cases, machine learning should ideally be performed on wearable devices themselves, which raises major computational limitations such as the battery capacity of smartwatches. This paper thus investigates frugal learning, aimed to build the most accurate possible models using the least amount of resources. A wide range of learning algorithms is examined through a frugal lens, analyzing their accuracy/runtime performance on a wide range of data sets. The most promising algorithms are thereafter assessed in a real-world scenario by implementing them in a smartwatch and letting them learn activity recognition models on the watch itself.},

Recent years have witnessed a paradigm shift in forecasting techniques and applications, from computer-assisted model- and assumptionbased to data-driven and fully-automated. This shift can be attributed to the availability of large, rich, and diverse time series data sources, posing unprecedented challenges to traditional time series forecasting methods. As such, how can we build statistical models to efficiently and effectively learn to forecast from large and diverse data sources? How can we leverage the statistical power of ``similar'' time series to improve forecasts in the case of limited observations? What are the implications for building forecasting systems that can handle large data volumes? The objective of this tutorial is to provide a concise and intuitive overview of the most important methods and tools available for solving large-scale forecasting problems. We review the state of the art in three related fields: (1) classical modeling of time series, (2) scalable tensor methods, and (3) deep learning for forecasting. Further, we share lessons learned from building scalable forecasting systems. While our focus is on providing an intuitive overview of the methods and practical issues, we also present technical details underlying these powerful tools.},

  abstract = {Estimating large covariance and precision matrices are fundamental in modern multivariate analysis. The problems arise from statistical analysis of large panel economics and finance data. The covariance matrix reveals marginal correlations between variables, while the precision matrix encodes conditional correlations between pairs of variables given the remaining variables. In this paper, we provide a selective review of several recent developments on estimating large covariance and precision matrices. We focus on two general approaches: rank based method and factor model based method. Theories and applications of both approaches are presented. These methods are expected to be widely applicable to analysis of economic and financial data.},

Studies have shown that traditional forecasting techniques are outperformed by deep learning models. Since then research work has been much focused on proposing different network models, little attention has been paid to improve the performance of existing models. In this paper, we compare the performance of several existing deep learning models used in both single and multiple time series forecasting tasks. We then propose two different approaches to improve the models' performance. Specifically, we present a fine-grained attention mechanism that achieves a much better performance for multi-step forecasting tasks. An ensemble technique is then proposed to further improve the performance of all the models.},

  abstract = {Time Series Classification (TSC) problems are encountered in many real life data mining tasks ranging from medicine and security to human activity recognition and food safety. With the recent success of deep neural networks in various domains such as computer vision and natural language processing, researchers started adopting these techniques for solving time series data mining problems. However, to the best of our knowledge, no previous work has considered the vulnerability of deep learning models to adversarial time series examples, which could potentially make them unreliable in situations where the decision taken by the classifier is crucial such as in medicine and security. For computer vision problems, such attacks have been shown to be very easy to perform by altering the image and adding an imperceptible amount of noise to trick the network into wrongly classifying the input image. Following this line of work, we propose to leverage existing adversarial attack mechanisms to add a special noise to the input time series in order to decrease the network's confidence when classifying instances at test time. Our results reveal that current state-of-the-art deep learning time series classifiers are vulnerable to adversarial attacks which can have major consequences in multiple domains such as food safety and quality assurance.},

This extends conformal prediction to apply to a larger class of online learning problems. Our method guarantees risk control at any user-specified level even when the underlying data distribution shifts drastically, even adversarially, over time in an unknown fashion. The technique we propose is highly flexible as it can be applied with any base online learning algorithm (e.g., a deep neural network trained online), requiring minimal implementation effort and essentially zero additional computational cost. We further extend our approach to control multiple risks simultaneously, so the prediction sets we generate are valid for all given risks. To demonstrate the utility of our method, we conduct experiments on real-world tabular time-series data sets showing that the proposed method rigorously controls various natural risks. Furthermore, we show how to construct valid intervals for an online image-depth estimation problem that previous sequential calibration schemes cannot handle.},

  abstract = {We develop a method to generate prediction intervals that have a user-specified coverage level across all regions of feature-space, a property called conditional coverage. A typical approach to this task is to estimate the conditional quantiles with quantile regression---it is well-known that this leads to correct coverage in the large-sample limit, although it may not be accurate in finite samples. We find in experiments that traditional quantile regression can have poor conditional coverage. To remedy this, we modify the loss function to promote independence between the size of the intervals and the indicator of a miscoverage event. For the true conditional quantiles, these two quantities are independent (orthogonal), so the modified loss function continues to be valid. Moreover, we empirically show that the modified loss function leads to improved conditional coverage, as evaluated by several metrics. We also introduce two new metrics that check conditional coverage by looking at the strength of the dependence between the interval size and the indicator of miscoverage.},

Even the same application will have a totally different impact on the network load when it is under clusters with different sizes, for the topology of the clusters is changed. Therefore, it is meaningful to do research on how to make use of the load of network from an application under a small cluster to predict the network load under a larger cluster, which will guide the data center on its infrastructure. In this paper, first of all, we address a new network load forecasting problem and collect network load generated by the operations of a designated computing intensive task (Terasort and GroupBy). Then we analyze the data and put forward the difficulties of the new problem. Finally, with a given set of data, we test the traditional machine learning models and the deep learning models respectively and provide a simple but effective model.},

The key novelty is that we propose to employ adversarial training to improve the generalization of a recurrent neural network model. The rationality of adversarial training here is that the input features to stock prediction are typically based on stock price, which is essentially a stochastic variable and continuously changed with time by nature. As such, normal training with stationary price-based features (e.g., the closing price) can easily overfit the data, being insufficient to obtain reliable models. To address this problem, we propose to add perturbations to simulate the stochasticity of continuous price variable, and train the model to work well under small yet intentional perturbations. Extensive experiments on two real-world stock data show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art solution (Xu and Cohen 2018) with 3.11\% relative improvements on average w.r.t. accuracy, verifying the usefulness of adversarial training for stock prediction task.

With daily returns of 0.46 percent and a Sharpe ratio of 5.8 prior to transaction costs, we find LSTM networks to outperform memory-free classification methods, i.e., a random forest (RAF), a deep neural net (DNN), and a logistic regression classifier (LOG). The outperformance relative to the general market is very clear from 1992 to 2009, but as of 2010, excess returns seem to have been arbitraged away with LSTM profitability fluctuating around zero after transaction costs. We further unveil sources of profitability, thereby shedding light into the black box of artificial neural networks. Specifically, we find one common pattern among the stocks selected for trading \textendash{} they exhibit high volatility and a short-term reversal return profile. Leveraging these findings, we are able to formalize a rules-based short-term reversal strategy that yields 0.23 percent prior to transaction costs.

  abstract = {Time series forecasting is challenging as sophisticated forecast models are computationally expensive to build. Recent research has addressed the integration of forecasting inside a DBMS. One main benefit is that models can be created once and then repeatedly used to answer forecast queries. Often forecast queries are submitted on higher aggregation levels, e. g., forecasts of sales over all locations. To answer such a forecast query, we have two possibilities. First, we can aggregate all base time series (sales in Austria, sales in Belgium...) and create only one model for the aggregate time series. Second, we can create models for all base time series and aggregate the base forecast values. The second possibility might lead to a higher accuracy but it is usually too expensive due to a high number of base time series. However, we actually do not need all base models to achieve a high accuracy, a sample of base models is enough. With this approach, we still achieve a better accuracy than an aggregate model, very similar to using all models, but we need less models to create and maintain in the database. We further improve this approach if new actual values of the base time series arrive at different points in time. With each new actual value we can refine the aggregate forecast and eventually converge towards the real actual value. Our experimental evaluation using several real-world data sets, shows a high accuracy of our approaches and a fast convergence towards the optimal value with increasing sample sizes and increasing number of actual values respectively.},

As the dimensionality increases, the sample covariance matrix becomes ill-conditioned or even singular. A common approach to estimating the covariance matrix when the dimensionality is large is that of Stein-type shrinkage estimation. A convex combination of the sample covariance matrix and a well-conditioned target matrix is used to estimate the covariance matrix. Recent work in the literature has shown that an optimal combination exists under mean-squared loss, however it must be estimated from the data. In this paper, we introduce a new set of estimators for the optimal convex combination for three commonly used target matrices. A simulation study shows an improvement over those in the literature in cases of extreme high-dimensionality of the data. A data analysis shows the estimators are effective in a discriminant and classification analysis.},

  abstract = {In many forecasting applications, it is valuable to predict not only the value of a signal at a certain time point in the future, but also the values leading up to that point. This is especially true in clinical applications, where the future state of the patient can be less important than the patient's overall trajectory. This requires multi-step forecasting, a forecasting variant where one aims to predict multiple values in the future simultaneously. Standard methods to accomplish this can propagate error from prediction to prediction, reducing quality over the long term. In light of these challenges, we propose multi-output deep architectures for multi-step forecasting in which we explicitly model the distribution of future values of the signal over a prediction horizon. We apply these techniques to the challenging and clinically relevant task of blood glucose forecasting. Through a series of experiments on a real-world dataset consisting of 550K blood glucose measurements, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approaches in capturing the underlying signal dynamics. Compared to existing shallow and deep methods, we find that our proposed approaches improve performance individually and capture complementary information, leading to a large improvement over the baseline when combined (4.87 vs. 5.31 absolute percentage error (APE)). Overall, the results suggest the efficacy of our proposed approach in predicting blood glucose level and multi-step forecasting more generally.},

It builds a surrogate for the objective and quantifies the uncertainty in that surrogate using a Bayesian machine learning technique, Gaussian process regression, and then uses an acquisition function defined from this surrogate to decide where to sample. In this tutorial, we describe how Bayesian optimization works, including Gaussian process regression and three common acquisition functions: expected improvement, entropy search, and knowledge gradient. We then discuss more advanced techniques, including running multiple function evaluations in parallel, multi-fidelity and multi-information source optimization, expensive-to-evaluate constraints, random environmental conditions, multi-task Bayesian optimization, and the inclusion of derivative information. We conclude with a discussion of Bayesian optimization software and future research directions in the field. Within our tutorial material we provide a generalization of expected improvement to noisy evaluations, beyond the noise-free setting where it is more commonly applied. This generalization is justified by a formal decision-theoretic argument, standing in contrast to previous ad hoc modifications.},

  abstract = {Random forests are a powerful method for non-parametric regression, but are limited in their ability to fit smooth signals, and can show poor predictive performance in the presence of strong, smooth effects. Taking the perspective of random forests as an adaptive kernel method, we pair the forest kernel with a local linear regression adjustment to better capture smoothness. The resulting procedure, local linear forests, enables us to improve on asymptotic rates of convergence for random forests with smooth signals, and provides substantial gains in accuracy on both real and simulated data. We prove a central limit theorem valid under regularity conditions on the forest and smoothness constraints, and propose a computationally efficient construction for confidence intervals. Moving to a causal inference application, we discuss the merits of local regression adjustments for heterogeneous treatment effect estimation, and give an example on a dataset exploring the effect word choice has on attitudes to the social safety net. Last, we include simulation results on real and generated data.},

A connection is made between stagewise additive expansions and steepest-descent minimization. A general gradient descent "boosting" paradigm is developed for additive expansions based on any fitting criterion. Specific algorithms are presented for least-squares, least absolute deviation, and Huber-M loss functions for regression, and multiclass logistic likelihood for classification. Special enhancements are derived for the particular case where the individual additive components are regression trees, and tools for interpreting such "TreeBoost" models are presented. Gradient boosting of regression trees produces competitive, highly robust, interpretable procedures for both regression and classification, especially appropriate for mining less than clean data.

They excel when the input data is high dimensional, the relationship between the input and the output is complicated, and the number of labeled training examples is large. But it is hard to explain why a learned network makes a particular classification decision on a particular test case. This is due to their reliance on distributed hierarchical representations. If we could take the knowledge acquired by the neural net and express the same knowledge in a model that relies on hierarchical decisions instead, explaining a particular decision would be much easier. We describe a way of using a trained neural net to create a type of soft decision tree that generalizes better than one learned directly from the training data.},

  abstract = {Explaining AI systems is fundamental both to the development of high performing models and to the trust placed in them by their users. A general framework for explaining any AI model is provided by the Shapley values that attribute the prediction output to the various model inputs ("features") in a principled and model-agnostic way. The outstanding strength of Shapley values is their combined generality and rigorous foundation: they can be used to explain any AI system, and one always understands their values as the unique attribution method satisfying a set of mathematical axioms. However, as a framework, Shapley values are too restrictive in one significant regard: they ignore all causal structure in the data. We introduce a less-restrictive framework for model-agnostic explainability: "Asymmetric" Shapley values. Asymmetric Shapley values (ASVs) are rigorously founded on a set of axioms, applicable to any AI system, and can flexibly incorporate any causal knowledge known a-priori to be respected by the data. We show through explicit, realistic examples that the ASV framework can be used to (i) improve model explanations by incorporating causal information, (ii) provide an unambiguous test for unfair discrimination based on simple policy articulations, (iii) enable sequentially incremental explanations in time-series models, and (iv) support feature-selection studies without the need for model retraining.},

This model captures spatial correlations among wind farms and temporal dependencies of wind power time series. First of all, we employ a multi-head self-attention mechanism to extract spatial correlations among wind farms. Then, temporal dependencies are captured by the Sequence-to-Sequence (Seq2Seq) model with a global attention mechanism. Finally, experimental results demonstrate that our model achieves better performance than other baseline approaches. Our work provides useful insights to capture non-Euclidean spatial correlations.},

We extend this concept from point forecasts to probabilistic forecasts by redefining forecast reconciliation in terms of linear functions in general, and projections more specifically. New theorems establish that the true predictive distribution can be recovered in the elliptical case by linear reconciliation, and general conditions are derived for when this is a projection. A geometric interpretation is also used to prove two new theoretical results for point forecasting; that reconciliation via projection both preserves unbiasedness and dominates unreconciled forecasts in a mean squared error sense. Strategies for forecast evaluation based on scoring rules are discussed, and it is shown that the popular log score is an improper scoring rule with respect to the class of unreconciled forecasts when the true predictive distribution coheres with aggregation constraints. Finally, evidence from a simulation study shows that reconciliation based on an oblique projection, derived from the MinT method of Wickramasuriya, Athanasopoulos \& Hyndman (2018) for point forecasting, outperforms both reconciled and unreconciled alternatives.},

Scalable learning and inference algorithms are derived by introducing a recognition model that yields fast sampling from the variational posterior. This recognition model is trained jointly with the generative model, by maximizing its variational lower bound on the log-likelihood.

However, the representational power of hyperbolic geometry is not yet on par with Euclidean geometry, mostly because of the absence of corresponding hyperbolic neural network layers. This makes it hard to use hyperbolic embeddings in downstream tasks. Here, we bridge this gap in a principled manner by combining the formalism of M\"obius gyrovector spaces with the Riemannian geometry of the Poincar\'e model of hyperbolic spaces. As a result, we derive hyperbolic versions of important deep learning tools: multinomial logistic regression, feed-forward and recurrent neural networks such as gated recurrent units. This allows to embed sequential data and perform classification in the hyperbolic space. Empirically, we show that, even if hyperbolic optimization tools are limited, hyperbolic sentence embeddings either outperform or are on par with their Euclidean variants on textual entailment and noisy-prefix recognition tasks.},

We introduce a novel application of case-based reasoning using prototypes to understand the decisions leading to the classification of time-series data, specifically investigating electrocardiogram (ECG) waveforms for classification of bradycardia, a slowing of heart rate, in infants. We improve upon existing models by explicitly optimizing for increased prototype diversity which in turn improves model accuracy by learning regions of the latent space that highlight features for distinguishing classes. We evaluate the hyperparameter space of our model to show robustness in diversity prototype generation and additionally, explore the resultant latent space of a deep classification network on ECG waveforms via an interactive tool to visualize the learned prototypical waveforms therein. We show that the prototypes are capable of learning real-world features - in our case-study ECG morphology related to bradycardia - as well as features within sub-classes. Our novel work leverages learned prototypical framework on two dimensional time-series data to produce explainable insights during classification tasks.},

By combining conformal prediction with randomized smoothing, our proposed method forms a prediction set with finite-sample coverage guarantee that holds for any data distribution with \$\textbackslash ell\_2\$-norm bounded adversarial noise, generated by any adversarial attack algorithm. The core idea is to bound the Lipschitz constant of the non-conformity score by smoothing it with Gaussian noise and leverage this knowledge to account for the effect of the unknown adversarial perturbation. We demonstrate the necessity of our method in the adversarial setting and the validity of our theoretical guarantee on three widely used benchmark data sets: CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and ImageNet.},

  abstract = {Optimal transport (OT) and maximum mean discrepancies (MMD) are now routinely used in machine learning to compare probability measures. We focus in this paper on \textbackslash emph\{Sinkhorn divergences\} (SDs), a regularized variant of OT distances which can interpolate, depending on the regularization strength \$\textbackslash varepsilon\$, between OT (\$\textbackslash varepsilon=0\$) and MMD (\$\textbackslash varepsilon=\textbackslash infty\$). Although the tradeoff induced by that regularization is now well understood computationally (OT, SDs and MMD require respectively \$O(n\^3\textbackslash log n)\$, \$O(n\^2)\$ and \$n\^2\$ operations given a sample size \$n\$), much less is known in terms of their \textbackslash emph\{sample complexity\}, namely the gap between these quantities, when evaluated using finite samples \textbackslash emph\{vs.\} their respective densities. Indeed, while the sample complexity of OT and MMD stand at two extremes, \$1/n\^\{1/d\}\$ for OT in dimension \$d\$ and \$1/\textbackslash sqrt\{n\}\$ for MMD, that for SDs has only been studied empirically. In this paper, we \textbackslash emph\{(i)\} derive a bound on the approximation error made with SDs when approximating OT as a function of the regularizer \$\textbackslash varepsilon\$, \textbackslash emph\{(ii)\} prove that the optimizers of regularized OT are bounded in a Sobolev (RKHS) ball independent of the two measures and \textbackslash emph\{(iii)\} provide the first sample complexity bound for SDs, obtained,by reformulating SDs as a maximization problem in a RKHS. We thus obtain a scaling in \$1/\textbackslash sqrt\{n\}\$ (as in MMD), with a constant that depends however on \$\textbackslash varepsilon\$, making the bridge between OT and MMD complete.},

It essentially consists of randomizing strongly both attribute and cut-point choice while splitting a tree node. In the extreme case, it builds totally randomized trees whose structures are independent of the output values of the learning sample. The strength of the randomization can be tuned to problem specifics by the appropriate choice of a parameter. We evaluate the robustness of the default choice of this parameter, and we also provide insight on how to adjust it in particular situations. Besides accuracy, the main strength of the resulting algorithm is computational efficiency. A bias/variance analysis of the Extra-Trees algorithm is also provided as well as a geometrical and a kernel characterization of the models induced.},

Motivated by recent advances in renewable energy integration and smart grids, we apply our proposed algorithm for wind speed forecasting. Renewable energy resources (wind and solar)are random in nature and, thus, their integration is facilitated with accurate short-term forecasts. In our proposed framework, we model the spatiotemporal information by a graph whose nodes are data generating entities and its edges basically model how these nodes are interacting with each other. One of the main contributions of our work is the fact that we obtain forecasts of all nodes of the graph at the same time based on one framework. Results of a case study on recorded time series data from a collection of wind mills in the north-east of the U.S. show that the proposed DL-based forecasting algorithm significantly improves the short-term forecasts compared to a set of widely-used benchmarks models.},

By contrast, common industry practice is to use a deterministic approximation of the future which is easier to understand and solve, but which is criticized for ignoring uncertainty. We show that a parameterized version of a deterministic lookahead can be an effective way of handling uncertainty, while enjoying the computational simplicity of a deterministic lookahead. We present the parameterized lookahead model as a form of policy for solving a stochastic base model, which is used as the basis for optimizing the parameterized policy. This approach can handle complex, high-dimensional state variables, and avoids the usual approximations associated with scenario trees. We formalize this approach and demonstrate its use in the context of a complex, nonstationary energy storage problem.},

Our framework builds on ideas from conformal inference to provide a general wrapper that can be combined with any black box method that produces point predictions of the unseen label or estimated quantiles of its distribution. While previous conformal inference methods rely on the assumption that the data are exchangeable, our adaptive approach provably achieves the desired coverage frequency over long-time intervals irrespective of the true data generating process. We accomplish this by modelling the distribution shift as a learning problem in a single parameter whose optimal value is varying over time and must be continuously re-estimated. We test our method, adaptive conformal inference, on two real world datasets and find that its predictions are robust to visible and significant distribution shifts.},

  abstract = {Forecast reconciliation is the post-forecasting process aimed to revise a set of incoherent base forecasts into coherent forecasts in line with given data structures. Most of the point and probabilistic regression-based forecast reconciliation results ground on the so called "structural representation" and on the related unconstrained generalized least squares reconciliation formula. However, the structural representation naturally applies to genuine hierarchical/grouped time series, where the top- and bottom-level variables are uniquely identified. When a general linearly constrained multiple time series is considered, the forecast reconciliation is naturally expressed according to a projection approach. While it is well known that the classic structural reconciliation formula is equivalent to its projection approach counterpart, so far it is not completely understood if and how a structural-like reconciliation formula may be derived for a general linearly constrained multiple time series. Such an expression would permit to extend reconciliation definitions, theorems and results in a straightforward manner. In this paper, we show that for general linearly constrained multiple time series it is possible to express the reconciliation formula according to a "structural-like" approach that keeps distinct free and constrained, instead of bottom and upper (aggregated), variables, establish the probabilistic forecast reconciliation framework, and apply these findings to obtain fully reconciled point and probabilistic forecasts for the aggregates of the Australian GDP from income and expenditure sides, and for the European Area GDP disaggregated by income, expenditure and output sides and by 19 countries.},

We propose a diagnostic approach to the evaluation of predictive performance that is based on the paradigm of maximizing the sharpness of the predictive distributions subject to calibration. Calibration refers to the statistical consistency between the distributional forecasts and the observations and is a joint property of the predictions and the events that materialize. Sharpness refers to the concentration of the predictive distributions and is a property of the forecasts only. A simple theoretical framework allows us to distinguish between probabilistic calibration, exceedance calibration and marginal calibration. We propose and study tools for checking calibration and sharpness, among them the probability integral transform histogram, marginal calibration plots, the sharpness diagram and proper scoring rules. The diagnostic approach is illustrated by an assessment and ranking of probabilistic forecasts of wind speed at the Stateline wind energy centre in the US Pacific Northwest. In combination with cross-validation or in the time series context, our proposal provides very general, nonparametric alternatives to the use of information criteria for model diagnostics and model selection.},

Traditional approaches such as VAR (vector auto-regressive) models and more recent approaches such as RNNs (recurrent neural networks) are indispensable tools in modeling time-series data. In many multivariate time series modeling problems, there is usually a significant linear dependency component, for which VARs are suitable, and a nonlinear component, for which RNNs are suitable. Modeling such times series with only VAR or only RNNs can lead to poor predictive performance or complex models with large training times. In this work, we propose a hybrid model called R2N2 (Residual RNN), which first models the time series with a simple linear model (like VAR) and then models its residual errors using RNNs. R2N2s can be trained using existing algorithms for VARs and RNNs. Through an extensive empirical evaluation on two real world datasets (aviation and climate domains), we show that R2N2 is competitive, usually better than VAR or RNN, used alone. We also show that R2N2 is faster to train as compared to an RNN, while requiring less number of hidden units.},

Specifically, heterogeneity is allowed for by assuming that these coefficients are bounded continuous functions of an observable variable and fluctuate between a limited number of ``extreme regimes''. The model can be viewed as a generalization of the threshold panel model of Hansen (1999). We extend the modelling strategy originally designed for univariate smooth transition regression models to the panel context. The strategy consists of model specification based on homogeneity tests, parameter estimation, and model evaluation, including tests of parameter constancy and no remaining heterogeneity. The model is applied to describing firms' investment decisions in the presence of capital market imperfections.},

However, the accuracy of these methods suffers greatly when modeling out-of-sample time series, significantly limiting their applicability compared to classical forecasting methods. To bridge this gap, we adopt a meta-learning view of the time series forecasting problem. We introduce a novel forecasting method, called Meta Global-Local Auto-Regression (Meta-GLAR), that adapts to each time series by learning in closed-form the mapping from the representations produced by a recurrent neural network (RNN) to one-step-ahead forecasts. Crucially, the parameters ofthe RNN are learned across multiple time series by backpropagating through the closed-form adaptation mechanism. In our extensive empirical evaluation we show that our method is competitive with the state-of-the-art in out-of-sample forecasting accuracy reported in earlier work.},

Simplicity in forecasting requires that (1) method, (2) representation of cumulative knowledge, (3) relationships in models, and (4) relationships among models, forecasts, and decisions are all sufficiently uncomplicated as to be easily understood by decision-makers. Our review of studies comparing simple and complex methods \textendash{} including those in this special issue \textendash{} found 97 comparisons in 32 papers. None of the papers provide a balance of evidence that complexity improves forecast accuracy. Complexity increases forecast error by 27 percent on average in the 25 papers with quantitative comparisons. The finding is consistent with prior research to identify valid forecasting methods: all 22 previously identified evidence-based forecasting procedures are simple. Nevertheless, complexity remains popular among researchers, forecasters, and clients. Some evidence suggests that the popularity of complexity may be due to incentives: (1) researchers are rewarded for publishing in highly ranked journals, which favor complexity; (2) forecasters can use complex methods to provide forecasts that support decision-makers' plans; and (3) forecasters' clients may be reassured by incomprehensibility. Clients who prefer accuracy should accept forecasts only from simple evidence-based procedures.

  abstract = {Human perception is structured around objects which form the basis for our higher-level cognition and impressive systematic generalization abilities. Yet most work on representation learning focuses on feature learning without even considering multiple objects, or treats segmentation as an (often supervised) preprocessing step. Instead, we argue for the importance of learning to segment and represent objects jointly. We demonstrate that, starting from the simple assumption that a scene is composed of multiple entities, it is possible to learn to segment images into interpretable objects with disentangled representations. Our method learns \textendash{} without supervision \textendash{} to inpaint occluded parts, and extrapolates to scenes with more objects and to unseen objects with novel feature combinations. We also show that, due to the use of iterative variational inference, our system is able to learn multi-modal posteriors for ambiguous inputs and extends naturally to sequences.},

  abstract = {Model-free reinforcement learning has been successfully applied to a range of challenging problems, and has recently been extended to handle large neural network policies and value functions. However, the sample complexity of modelfree algorithms, particularly when using highdimensional function approximators, tends to limit their applicability to physical systems. In this paper, we explore algorithms and representations to reduce the sample complexity of deep reinforcement learning for continuous control tasks. We propose two complementary techniques for improving the efficiency of such algorithms. First, we derive a continuous variant of the Q-learning algorithm, which we call normalized adantage functions (NAF), as an alternative to the more commonly used policy gradient and actor-critic methods. NAF representation allows us to apply Q-learning with experience replay to continuous tasks, and substantially improves performance on a set of simulated robotic control tasks. To further improve the efficiency of our approach, we explore the use of learned models for accelerating model-free reinforcement learning. We show that iteratively refitted local linear models are especially effective for this, and demonstrate substantially faster learning on domains where such models are applicable.},

  abstract = {Principal component analysis (PCA) is a well-established tool in machine learning and data processing. The principal axes in PCA were shown to be equivalent to the maximum marginal likelihood estimator of the factor loading matrix in a latent factor model for the observed data, assuming that the latent factors are independently distributed as standard normal distributions. However, the independence assumption may be unrealistic for many scenarios such as modeling multiple time series, spatial processes, and functional data, where the outcomes are correlated. In this paper, we introduce the generalized probabilistic principal component analysis (GPPCA) to study the latent factor model for multiple correlated outcomes, where each factor is modeled by a Gaussian process. Our method generalizes the previous probabilistic formulation of PCA (PPCA) by providing the closedform maximum marginal likelihood estimator of the factor loadings and other parameters. Based on the explicit expression of the precision matrix in the marginal likelihood that we derived, the number of the computational operations is linear to the number of output variables. Furthermore, we also provide the closed-form expression of the marginal likelihood when other covariates are included in the mean structure. We highlight the advantage of GPPCA in terms of the practical relevance, estimation accuracy and computational convenience. Numerical studies of simulated and real data confirm the excellent finite-sample performance of the proposed approach.},

We introduce a differentiable loss function suitable for training deep neural nets, and provide a custom back-prop implementation for speeding up optimization. We also introduce a variant of DILATE, which provides a smooth generalization of temporally-constrained Dynamic Time Warping (DTW). Experiments carried out on various non-stationary datasets reveal the very good behaviour of DILATE compared to models trained with the standard Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss function, and also to DTW and variants.

The accurate prediction of day-ahead electricity prices is an active research field and available data from various markets can be used as input for forecasting. A collection of models have been proposed for this task, but the fundamental question on how to use the available big data is often neglected. In this paper, we propose to use transfer learning as a tool for utilizing information from other electricity price markets for forecasting. We pre-train a neural network model on source markets and finally do a fine-tuning for the target market. Moreover, we test different ways to use the rich input data from various electricity price markets to forecast 24 steps ahead in hourly frequency. Our experiments on four different day-ahead markets indicate that transfer learning improves the electricity price forecasting performance in a statistically significant manner. Furthermore, we compare our results with state-of-the-art methods in a rolling window scheme to demonstrate the performance of the transfer learning approach. Our method improves the performance of the state-of-the-art algorithms by 7\% for the French market and 3\% for the German market.},

We have also proposed a novel probability-based discretization approach to model probabilistic uncertainty during partitioning of time series data. Gaussian probability distribution function is used in this research paper to associate probabilities to membership grades and probabilistic fuzzy elements are aggregated to a fuzzy row vector using an aggregation operator. Major advantages of the proposed method are that it includes both types of uncertainties in a single framework and enhances accuracy in forecast as well. To show its suitability and outperformance over other existing forecasting methods, the proposed method is implemented in University of Alabama enrolments and TAIFEX time series datasets.

Within medical imaging, accurate regression models have the potential to automate various tasks, helping to lower costs and improve patient outcomes. Such safety-critical deployment does however require reliable estimation of model uncertainty, also under the wide variety of distribution shifts that might be encountered in practice. Motivated by this, we set out to investigate the reliability of regression uncertainty estimation methods under various real-world distribution shifts. To that end, we propose an extensive benchmark of 8 image-based regression datasets with different types of challenging distribution shifts. We then employ our benchmark to evaluate many of the most common uncertainty estimation methods, as well as two state-of-the-art uncertainty scores from the task of out-of-distribution detection. We find that while methods are well calibrated when there is no distribution shift, they all become highly overconfident on many of the benchmark datasets. This uncovers important limitations of current uncertainty estimation methods, and the proposed benchmark therefore serves as a challenge to the research community. We hope that our benchmark will spur more work on how to develop truly reliable regression uncertainty estimation methods. Code is available at https://github.com/fregu856/regression\_uncertainty.},

  abstract = {Subsequence clustering of multivariate time series is a useful tool for discovering repeated patterns in temporal data. Once these patterns have been discovered, seemingly complicated datasets can be interpreted as a temporal sequence of only a small number of states, or clusters. For example, raw sensor data from a fitness-tracking application can be expressed as a timeline of a select few actions (i.e., walking, sitting, running). However, discovering these patterns is challenging because it requires simultaneous segmentation and clustering of the time series. Furthermore, interpreting the resulting clusters is difficult, especially when the data is high-dimensional. Here we propose a new method of model-based clustering, which we call Toeplitz Inverse Covariance-based Clustering (TICC). Each cluster in the TICC method is defined by a correlation network, or Markov random field (MRF), characterizing the interdependencies between different observations in a typical subsequence of that cluster. Based on this graphical representation, TICC simultaneously segments and clusters the time series data. We solve the TICC problem through alternating minimization, using a variation of the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm. We derive closed-form solutions to efficiently solve the two resulting subproblems in a scalable way, through dynamic programming and the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM), respectively. We validate our approach by comparing TICC to several state-of-the-art baselines in a series of synthetic experiments, and we then demonstrate on an automobile sensor dataset how TICC can be used to learn interpretable clusters in real-world scenarios.},

  abstract = {Neural networks are both computationally intensive and memory intensive, making them difficult to deploy on embedded systems with limited hardware resources. To address this limitation, we introduce ``deep compression'', a three stage pipeline: pruning, trained quantization and Huffman coding, that work together to reduce the storage requirement of neural networks by 35\texttimes{} to 49\texttimes{} without affecting their accuracy. Our method first prunes the network by learning only the important connections. Next, we quantize the weights to enforce weight sharing, finally, we apply Huffman coding. After the first two steps we retrain the network to fine tune the remaining connections and the quantized centroids. Pruning, reduces the number of connections by 9\texttimes{} to 13\texttimes; Quantization then reduces the number of bits that represent each connection from 32 to 5. On the ImageNet dataset, our method reduced the storage required by AlexNet by 35\texttimes, from 240MB to 6.9MB, without loss of accuracy. Our method reduced the size of VGG-16 by 49\texttimes{} from 552MB to 11.3MB, again with no loss of accuracy. This allows fitting the model into on-chip SRAM cache rather than off-chip DRAM memory. Our compression method also facilitates the use of complex neural networks in mobile applications where application size and download bandwidth are constrained. Benchmarked on CPU, GPU and mobile GPU, compressed network has 3\texttimes{} to 4\texttimes{} layerwise speedup and 3\texttimes{} to 7\texttimes{} better energy efficiency.},

  abstract = {Many real-life applications involve simultaneously forecasting multiple time series that are hierarchically related via aggregation or disaggregation operations. For instance, commercial organizations often want to forecast inventories simultaneously at store, city, and state levels for resource planning purposes. In such applications, it is important that the forecasts, in addition to being reasonably accurate, are also consistent w.r.t one another. Although forecasting such hierarchical time series has been pursued by economists and data scientists, the current state-of-the-art models use strong assumptions, e.g., all forecasts being unbiased estimates, noise distribution being Gaussian. Besides, state-of-the-art models have not harnessed the power of modern nonlinear models, especially ones based on deep learning. In this paper, we propose using a flexible nonlinear model that optimizes quantile regression loss coupled with suitable regularization terms to maintain the consistency of forecasts across hierarchies. The theoretical framework introduced herein can be applied to any forecasting model with an underlying differentiable loss function. A proof of optimality of our proposed method is also provided. Simulation studies over a range of datasets highlight the efficacy of our approach.},

  abstract = {Interactive service providers have strict requirements on high-percentile (tail) latency to meet user expectations. If providers meet tail latency targets with less energy, they increase profits, because energy is a significant operating expense. Unfortunately, optimizing tail latency and energy are typically conflicting goals. Our work resolves this conflict by exploiting servers with per-core Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling (DVFS) and Asymmetric Multicore Processors (AMPs). We introduce the Adaptive Slow-to- Fast scheduling framework, which matches the heterogeneity of the workload-a mix of short and long requests-to the heterogeneity of the hardware- cores running at different speeds. The scheduler prioritizes long requests to faster cores by exploiting the insight that long requests reveal themselves. We use control theory to design threshold-based scheduling policies that use individual request progress, load, competition, and latency targets to optimize performance and energy. We configure our framework to optimize Energy Efficiency for a given Tail Latency (EETL) for both DVFS and AMP. In this framework, each request self-schedules, starting on a slow core and then migrating itself to faster cores. At high load, when a desired AMP core speed s is not available for a request but a faster core is, the longest request on an s core type migrates early to make room for the other request. Compared to per-core DVFS systems, EETL for AMPs delivers the same tail latency, reduces energy by 18\% to 50\%, and improves capacity (throughput) by 32\% to 82\%. We demonstrate that our framework effectively exploits dynamic DVFS and static AMP heterogeneity to reduce provisioning and operational costs for interactive services.},

  abstract = {Long memory in the sense of slowly decaying autocorrelations is a stylized fact in many time series from economics and finance. The fractionally integrated process is the workhorse model for the analysis of these time series. Nevertheless, there is mixed evidence in the literature concerning its usefulness for forecasting and how forecasting based on it should be implemented. Employing pseudo-out-of-sample forecasting on inflation and realized volatility time series and simulations we show that methods based on fractional integration clearly are superior to alternative methods not accounting for long memory, including autoregressions and exponential smoothing. Our proposal of choosing a fixed fractional integration parameter of \$d=0.5\$ a priori yields the best results overall, capturing long memory behavior, but overcoming the deficiencies of methods using an estimated parameter. Regarding the implementation of forecasting methods based on fractional integration, we use simulations to compare local and global semiparametric and parametric estimators of the long memory parameter from the Whittle family and provide asymptotic theory backed up by simulations to compare different mean estimators. Both of these analyses lead to new results, which are also of interest outside the realm of forecasting.},

This has resulted in a need for forecasting techniques that effectively leverage all available data by learning across all time series in each panel. Among the desirable properties of forecasting techniques, being able to generate probabilistic predictions ranks among the top. In this paper, we therefore present Level Set Forecaster (LSF), a simple yet effective general approach to transform a point estimator into a probabilistic one. By recognizing the connection of our algorithm to random forests (RFs) and quantile regression forests (QRFs), we are able to prove consistency guarantees of our approach under mild assumptions on the underlying point estimator. As a byproduct, we prove the first consistency results for QRFs under the CART-splitting criterion. Empirical experiments show that our approach, equipped with tree-based models as the point estimator, rivals state-of-the-art deep learning models in terms of forecasting accuracy.},

Under this constraint, the designs of the network architectures should exhibit as trade-offs among the factors like depth, numbers of filters, filter sizes, etc. With a series of controlled comparisons, we progressively modify a baseline model while preserving its time complexity. This is also helpful for understanding the importance of the factors in network designs.

  abstract = {Abstract Some time ago, the continuous ranked probability score (CRPS) was proposed as a new verification tool for (probabilistic) forecast systems. Its focus is on the entire permissible range of a certain (weather) parameter. The CRPS can be seen as a ranked probability score with an infinite number of classes, each of zero width. Alternatively, it can be interpreted as the integral of the Brier score over all possible threshold values for the parameter under consideration. For a deterministic forecast system the CRPS reduces to the mean absolute error. In this paper it is shown that for an ensemble prediction system the CRPS can be decomposed into a reliability part and a resolution/uncertainty part, in a way that is similar to the decomposition of the Brier score. The reliability part of the CRPS is closely connected to the rank histogram of the ensemble, while the resolution/uncertainty part can be related to the average spread within the ensemble and the behavior of its outliers. The usefulness of such a decomposition is illustrated for the ensemble prediction system running at the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts. The evaluation of the CRPS and its decomposition proposed in this paper can be extended to systems issuing continuous probability forecasts, by realizing that these can be interpreted as the limit of ensemble forecasts with an infinite number of members.},

Domain experts are interested in error measures relevant for their decision making needs. Such measures may produce unreliable results. Although reliability properties of several metrics have already been discussed, it has hardly been quantified in an objective way. We propose a measure named Rank Stability, which evaluates how much the rankings of an experiment differ in between similar datasets, when the models and errors are constant. We use this to study the evaluation setup of the M5. We find that the evaluation setup of the M5 is less reliable than other measures. The main drivers of instability are hierarchical aggregation and scaling. Price-weighting reduces the stability of all tested error measures. Scale normalization of the M5 error measure results in less stability than other scale-free errors. Hierarchical levels taken separately are less stable with more aggregation, and their combination is even less stable than individual levels. We also show positive tradeoffs of retaining aggregation importance without affecting stability. Aggregation and stability can be linked to the influence of much debated magic numbers. Many of our findings can be applied to general hierarchical forecast benchmarking.},

In these areas, RNNs have still a long way to go. We present an extensive empirical study and an open-source software framework of existing RNN architectures for forecasting, and we develop guidelines and best practices for their use. For example, we conclude that RNNs are capable of modelling seasonality directly if the series in the dataset possess homogeneous seasonal patterns; otherwise, we recommend a deseasonalisation step. Comparisons against ETS and ARIMA demonstrate that (semi-) automatic RNN models are not silver bullets, but they are nevertheless competitive alternatives in many situations.},

  abstract = {Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are currently state-of-the-art for various classification tasks, but are computationally expensive. Propagating through the convolutional layers is very slow, as each kernel in each layer must sequentially calculate many dot products for a single forward and backward propagation which equates to \$\textbackslash mathcal\{O\}(N\^\{2\}n\^\{2\})\$ per kernel per layer where the inputs are \$N \textbackslash times N\$ arrays and the kernels are \$n \textbackslash times n\$ arrays. Convolution can be efficiently performed as a Hadamard product in the frequency domain. The bottleneck is the transformation which has a cost of \$\textbackslash mathcal\{O\}(N\^\{2\}\textbackslash log\_2 N)\$ using the fast Fourier transform (FFT). However, the increase in efficiency is less significant when \$N\textbackslash gg n\$ as is the case in CNNs. We mitigate this by using the "overlap-and-add" technique reducing the computational complexity to \$\textbackslash mathcal\{O\}(N\^2\textbackslash log\_2 n)\$ per kernel. This method increases the algorithm's efficiency in both the forward and backward propagation, reducing the training and testing time for CNNs. Our empirical results show our method reduces computational time by a factor of up to 16.3 times the traditional convolution implementation for a 8 \$\textbackslash times\$ 8 kernel and a 224 \$\textbackslash times\$ 224 image.},

  abstract = {This paper introduces a novel approach to quantify demand \& weather uncertainty in power system models. Recent studies indicate that such sampling uncertainty, originating from demand \& weather time series inputs, leads to significant uncertainties in model outputs and should not be ignored, especially with increasing levels of weather-dependent renewable generation. However, established uncertainty quantification approaches fail in this context due to the computational resources and additional data required for Monte Carlo-based analysis. The methodology introduced in this paper quantifies demand \& weather uncertainty using a time series bootstrap scheme with shorter time series than the original, enhancing computational efficiency and avoiding the need for any additional data. It can be used both to quantify output uncertainty and to determine optimal sample lengths for prescribed confidence levels. Simulations are performed on three generation \& transmission expansion planning models and a simple test is introduced allowing users to determine whether estimated uncertainty bounds are valid. Furthermore, a set of sample power system models, along with 38 years of time series data, are made available as open-source software and may serve as benchmarks for further renewable energy or time series analysis.},

Unfortunately, making predictions using a whole ensemble of models is cumbersome and may be too computationally expensive to allow deployment to a large number of users, especially if the individual models are large neural nets. Caruana and his collaborators [1] have shown that it is possible to compress the knowledge in an ensemble into a single model which is much easier to deploy and we develop this approach further using a different compression technique. We achieve some surprising results on MNIST and we show that we can significantly improve the acoustic model of a heavily used commercial system by distilling the knowledge in an ensemble of models into a single model. We also introduce a new type of ensemble composed of one or more full models and many specialist models which learn to distinguish fine-grained classes that the full models confuse. Unlike a mixture of experts, these specialist models can be trained rapidly and in parallel.},

This "overfitting" is greatly reduced by randomly omitting half of the feature detectors on each training case. This prevents complex co-adaptations in which a feature detector is only helpful in the context of several other specific feature detectors. Instead, each neuron learns to detect a feature that is generally helpful for producing the correct answer given the combinatorially large variety of internal contexts in which it must operate. Random "dropout" gives big improvements on many benchmark tasks and sets new records for speech and object recognition.},

We briefly review Hochreiter's (1991) analysis of this problem, then address it by introducing a novel, efficient, gradient based method called long short-term memory (LSTM). Truncating the gradient where this does not do harm, LSTM can learn to bridge minimal time lags in excess of 1000 discrete-time steps by enforcing constant error flow through constant error carousels within special units. Multiplicative gate units learn to open and close access to the constant error flow. LSTM is local in space and time; its computational complexity per time step and weight is O. 1. Our experiments with artificial data involve local, distributed, real-valued, and noisy pattern representations. In comparisons with real-time recurrent learning, back propagation through time, recurrent cascade correlation, Elman nets, and neural sequence chunking, LSTM leads to many more successful runs, and learns much faster. LSTM also solves complex, artificial long-time-lag tasks that have never been solved by previous recurrent network algorithms.},

  abstract = {A series of recent papers introduce the concept of Forecast Reconciliation, a process by which independently generated forecasts of a collection of linearly related time series are reconciled via the introduction of accounting aggregations that naturally apply to the data. Aside from its clear presentational and operational virtues, the reconciliation approach generally improves the accuracy of the combined forecasts. In this paper, we examine the mechanisms by which this improvement is generated by re-formulating the reconciliation problem as a combination of direct forecasts of each time series with additional indirect forecasts derived from the linear constraints. Our work establishes a direct link between the nascent Forecast Reconciliation literature and the extensive work on Forecast Combination. In the original hierarchical setting, our approach clarifies for the first time how unbiased forecasts for the entire collection can be generated from base forecasts made at any level of the hierarchy, and we illustrate more generally how simple robust combined forecasts can be generated in any multivariate setting subject to linear constraints. In an empirical example, we show that simple combinations of such forecasts generate significant improvements in forecast accuracy where it matters most: where noise levels are highest and the forecasting task is at its most challenging.},

However, precise trend prediction is very difficult since the highly volatile and non-stationary nature of the stock market. Exploding information on the Internet together with the advancing development of natural language processing and text mining techniques have enabled investors to unveil market trends and volatility from online content. Unfortunately, the quality, trustworthiness, and comprehensiveness of online content related to stock market vary drastically, and a large portion consists of the low-quality news, comments, or even rumors. To address this challenge, we imitate the learning process of human beings facing such chaotic online news, driven by three principles: sequential content dependency, diverse influence, and effective and efficient learning. In this paper, to capture the first two principles, we designed a Hybrid Attention Networks(HAN) to predict the stock trend based on the sequence of recent related news. Moreover, we apply the self-paced learning mechanism to imitate the third principle. Extensive experiments on real-world stock market data demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework. A further simulation illustrates that a straightforward trading strategy based on our proposed framework can significantly increase the annualized return.},

Learning long-range dependencies that are embedded in time series is often an obstacle for most algorithms, whereas Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) solutions, as a specific kind of scheme in deep learning, promise to effectively overcome the problem. In this article, we first give a brief introduction to the structure and forward propagation mechanism of the LSTM model. Then, aiming at reducing the considerable computing cost of LSTM, we put forward the Random Connectivity LSTM (RCLSTM) model and test it by predicting traffic and user mobility in telecommunication networks. Compared to LSTM, RCLSTM is formed via stochastic connectivity between neurons, which achieves a significant breakthrough in the architecture formation of neural networks. In this way, the RCLSTM model exhibits a certain level of sparsity, which leads to an appealing decrease in the computational complexity and makes the RCLSTM model become more applicable in latency-stringent application scenarios. In the field of telecommunication networks, the prediction of traffic series and mobility traces could directly benefit from this improvement as we further demonstrate that the prediction accuracy of RCLSTM is comparable to that of the conventional LSTM no matter how we change the number of training samples or the length of input sequences.},

In this paper, we study causal discovery and forecasting for nonstationary time series. By exploiting a particular type of state-space model to represent the processes, we show that nonstationarity helps to identify causal structure and that forecasting naturally benefits from learned causal knowledge. Specifically, we allow changes in both causal strengths and noise variances in the nonlinear state-space models, which, interestingly, renders both the causal structure and model parameters identifiable. Given the causal model, we treat forecasting as a problem in Bayesian inference in the causal model, which exploits the time-varying property of the data and adapts to new observations in a principled manner. Experimental results on synthetic and real-world data sets demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed methods.},

The constraints arise due to the need for forecasts of collections of time series to add up in the same way as the observed time series. It is also shown that the computations involved can be handled efficiently by exploiting the structure of the associated design matrix, or by using sparse matrix routines. The proposed algorithms make forecast reconciliation feasible in business applications involving very large numbers of time series.},

  abstract = {Exponential smoothing methods have been around since the 1950s, and are still the most popular forecasting methods used in business and industry. However, a modeling framework incorporating stochastic models, likelihood calculation, prediction intervals and procedures for model selection, was not developed until recently. This book brings together all of the important new results on the state space framework for exponential smoothing. It will be of interest to people wanting to apply the methods in their own area of interest as well as for researchers wanting to take the ideas in new directions. Part 1 provides an introduction to exponential smoothing and the underlying models. The essential details are given in Part 2, which also provide links to the most important papers in the literature. More advanced topics are covered in Part 3, including the mathematical properties of the models and extensions of the models for specific problems. Applications to particular domains are discussed in Part 4.},

We call these ``hierarchical time series''. They are commonly forecast using either a ``bottom-up'' or a ``top-down'' method. In this paper we propose a new approach to hierarchical forecasting which provides optimal forecasts that are better than forecasts produced by either a top-down or a bottom-up approach. Our method is based on independently forecasting all series at all levels of the hierarchy and then using a regression model to optimally combine and reconcile these forecasts. The resulting revised forecasts add up appropriately across the hierarchy, are unbiased and have minimum variance amongst all combination forecasts under some simple assumptions. We show in a simulation study that our method performs well compared to the top-down approach and the bottom-up method. We demonstrate our proposed method by forecasting Australian tourism demand where the data are disaggregated by purpose of travel and geographical region.},

For a given accuracy level, it is typically possible to identify multiple CNN architectures that achieve that accuracy level. With equivalent accuracy, smaller CNN architectures offer at least three advantages: (1) Smaller CNNs require less communication across servers during distributed training. (2) Smaller CNNs require less bandwidth to export a new model from the cloud to an autonomous car. (3) Smaller CNNs are more feasible to deploy on FPGAs and other hardware with limited memory. To provide all of these advantages, we propose a small CNN architecture called SqueezeNet. SqueezeNet achieves AlexNet-level accuracy on ImageNet with 50x fewer parameters. Additionally, with model compression techniques, we are able to compress SqueezeNet to less than 0.5MB (510\texttimes{} smaller than AlexNet).},

Regression in time-changing data streams is a relatively unexplored topic, despite the apparent applications. This paper proposes an efficient and incremental stream mining algorithm which is able to learn regression and model trees from possibly unbounded, high-speed and time-changing data streams. The algorithm is evaluated extensively in a variety of settings involving artificial and real data. To the best of our knowledge there is no other general purpose algorithm for incremental learning regression/model trees able to perform explicit change detection and informed adaptation. The algorithm performs online and in real-time, observes each example only once at the speed of arrival, and maintains at any-time a ready-to-use model tree. The tree leaves contain linear models induced online from the examples assigned to them, a process with low complexity. The algorithm has mechanisms for drift detection and model adaptation, which enable it to maintain accurate and updated regression models at any time. The drift detection mechanism exploits the structure of the tree in the process of local change detection. As a response to local drift, the algorithm is able to update the tree structure only locally. This approach improves the any-time performance and greatly reduces the costs of adaptation.},

Decision forests are computationally efficient thanks to their conditional computation property (computation is confined to only a small region of the tree, the nodes along a single branch). CNNs achieve state of the art accuracy, thanks to their representation learning capabilities. We present a systematic analysis of how to fuse conditional computation with representation learning and achieve a continuum of hybrid models with different ratios of accuracy vs. efficiency. We call this new family of hybrid models conditional networks. Conditional networks can be thought of as: i) decision trees augmented with data transformation operators, or ii) CNNs, with block-diagonal sparse weight matrices, and explicit data routing functions. Experimental validation is performed on the common task of image classification on both the CIFAR and Imagenet datasets. Compared to state of the art CNNs, our hybrid models yield the same accuracy with a fraction of the compute cost and much smaller number of parameters.},

  abstract = {Training Deep Neural Networks is complicated by the fact that the distribution of each layer's inputs changes during training, as the parameters of the previous layers change. This slows down the training by requiring lower learning rates and careful parameter initialization, and makes it notoriously hard to train models with saturating nonlinearities. We refer to this phenomenon as internal covariate shift, and address the problem by normalizing layer inputs. Our method draws its strength from making normalization a part of the model architecture and performing the normalization for each training mini-batch. Batch Normalization allows us to use much higher learning rates and be less careful about initialization. It also acts as a regularizer, in some cases eliminating the need for Dropout. Applied to a state-of-the-art image classification model, Batch Normalization achieves the same accuracy with 14 times fewer training steps, and beats the original model by a significant margin. Using an ensemble of batchnormalized networks, we improve upon the best published result on ImageNet classification: reaching 4.9\% top-5 validation error (and 4.8\% test error), exceeding the accuracy of human raters.},

  abstract = {Training directed neural networks typically requires forward-propagating data through a computation graph, followed by backpropagating error signal, to produce weight updates. All layers, or more generally, modules, of the network are therefore locked, in the sense that they must wait for the remainder of the network to execute forwards and propagate error backwards before they can be updated. In this work we break this constraint by decoupling modules by introducing a model of the future computation of the network graph. These models predict what the result of the modelled subgraph will produce using only local information. In particular we focus on modelling error gradients: by using the modelled synthetic gradient in place of true backpropagated error gradients we decouple subgraphs, and can update them independently and asynchronously i.e. we realise decoupled neural interfaces. We show results for feed-forward models, where every layer is trained asynchronously, recurrent neural networks (RNNs) where predicting one's future gradient extends the time over which the RNN can effectively model, and also a hierarchical RNN system with ticking at different timescales. Finally, we demonstrate that in addition to predicting gradients, the same framework can be used to predict inputs, resulting in models which are decoupled in both the forward and backwards pass \textendash{} amounting to independent networks which co-learn such that they can be composed into a single functioning corporation.},

First, using a priori knowledge of an expert, all known possible features are clustered in some categories so that each category includes homogeneous features. Then, a novel evolving correlation-based forward subset selection technique is used to determine relevant features from each category. Next, based on the selected features, an estimation of the output of the system is modeled through an evolving adaptive linear regression model. In evolving systems, selected features and their associated weights could vary over time based on new incoming data samples which contain new information. Finally, a soft combination of output estimations of all categories, in a new sense of Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy system, gives the prediction of the output of the system at each sampling time. The approach offers a certain new view at the enhancement of evolving forecasting models. The proposed approach embodies recursive learning and one-step-ahead incremental algorithms that progressively modify the model to ensure continuous learning, and self-organization of the model structure and its parameters. Two real-world problems, forecasting electricity load of the Electric Reliability Council of Texas region and stock price forecasting of technology sector of Standard \& Poor's 500 index, are provided to validate the developed method. Pros and cons of the proposed approach are comprehensively discussed and shown through simulation results and comparisons with other state-of-the-art techniques.},

EnCQR exploits a bootstrap ensemble estimator, which enables the use of conformal predictors for time series by removing the requirement of data exchangeability. The ensemble learners are implemented as generic machine learning algorithms performing quantile regression (QR), which allow the length of the PIs to adapt to local variability in the data. In the experiments, we predict time series characterized by a different amount of heteroscedasticity. The results demonstrate that EnCQR outperforms models based only on QR or conformal prediction (CP), and it provides sharper, more informative, and valid PIs.},

In this survey, we review the rapidly growing body of research using different graph neural networks, e.g. graph convolutional and graph attention networks, in various traffic forecasting problems, e.g. road traffic flow and speed forecasting, passenger flow forecasting in urban rail transit systems, and demand forecasting in ride-hailing platforms. We also present a comprehensive list of open data and source resources for each problem and identify future research directions. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first comprehensive survey that explores the application of graph neural networks for traffic forecasting problems. We have also created a public GitHub repository where the latest papers, open data, and source resources will be updated.},

  abstract = {Temporal data, notably time series and spatio-temporal data, are prevalent in real-world applications. They capture dynamic system measurements and are produced in vast quantities by both physical and virtual sensors. Analyzing these data types is vital to harnessing the rich information they encompass and thus benefits a wide range of downstream tasks. Recent advances in large language and other foundational models have spurred increased use of these models in time series and spatio-temporal data mining. Such methodologies not only enable enhanced pattern recognition and reasoning across diverse domains but also lay the groundwork for artificial general intelligence capable of comprehending and processing common temporal data. In this survey, we offer a comprehensive and up-to-date review of large models tailored (or adapted) for time series and spatio-temporal data, spanning four key facets: data types, model categories, model scopes, and application areas/tasks. Our objective is to equip practitioners with the knowledge to develop applications and further research in this underexplored domain. We primarily categorize the existing literature into two major clusters: large models for time series analysis (LM4TS) and spatio-temporal data mining (LM4STD). On this basis, we further classify research based on model scopes (i.e., general vs. domain-specific) and application areas/tasks. We also provide a comprehensive collection of pertinent resources, including datasets, model assets, and useful tools, categorized by mainstream applications. This survey coalesces the latest strides in large model-centric research on time series and spatio-temporal data, underscoring the solid foundations, current advances, practical applications, abundant resources, and future research opportunities.},

This paper tackles the problem of better utilizing GPUs for this task. While GPUs excel at data-parallel tasks, prior approaches are bottlenecked by algorithms that expose less parallelism, such as k-min selection, or make poor use of the memory hierarchy. We propose a design for k-selection that operates at up to 55\% of theoretical peak performance, enabling a nearest neighbor implementation that is 8.5\texttimes{} faster than prior GPU state of the art. We apply it in different similarity search scenarios, by proposing optimized design for brute-force, approximate and compressed-domain search based on product quantization. In all these setups, we outperform the state of the art by large margins. Our implementation enables the construction of a high accuracy k-NN graph on 95 million images from the Yfcc100M dataset in 35 minutes, and of a graph connecting 1 billion vectors in less than 12 hours on 4 Maxwell Titan X GPUs. We have open-sourced our approach1 for the sake of comparison and reproducibility.},

Under the demand with the price sensitivity, inventory sensitivity and randomness, we formulate a more practical two-stage joint optimization model of inventory control and promotion, in which the non-promotional optimal price and allocation of shelf-space of all kinds of products are calculated to achieve maximal profit in the first stage and then to find the optimal promotion brands under the assumptions of non-promoted brands still continue the pricing policy and shelf-space allocation policy in the second stage model. Also a numerical solving algorithm is proposed and an experimental example is given. Our experimental analysis reveals that the two-stage joint optimization model has good feasibility and robustness. The computational results also show that the appropriate inventory control strategies and promotional methods would achieve higher profit.},

Comparative analysis was then performed on CPO price forecasting results using the machine learning techniques. Monthly CPO prices, selected vegetable oil prices, crude oil prices and monthly exchange rate data from January 1987 to February 2017 were utilized. Preliminary analysis showed a positive and high correlation between the CPO price and soy bean oil price and also between CPO price and crude oil price. Experiments were conducted using multi-layer perception, support vector regression and Holt Winter exponential smoothing techniques. The results were assessed by using criteria of root mean square error (RMSE), means absolute error (MAE), means absolute percentage error (MAPE) and Direction of accuracy (DA). Among these three techniques, support vector regression(SVR) with Sequential minimal optimization (SMO) algorithm showed relatively better results compared to multi-layer perceptron and Holt Winters exponential smoothing method.},

To improve statistical forecasting performance, forecasters typically select the most appropriate model for each given time series. However, statistical models usually presume some data generation process, while making strong distributional assumptions about the errors. In this paper, we present a new approach to time series forecasting that relaxes these assumptions. A target series is forecasted by identifying similar series from a reference set (de\textasciiacute ja` vu). Instead of extrapolating, the future paths of the similar reference series are aggregated and serve as the basis for the forecasts of the target series. ``Forecasting with similarity'' is a data-centric approach that tackles model uncertainty without depending on statistical forecasting models. We offer definitions for deriving both the point forecasts and the corresponding prediction intervals. We evaluate the approach using a rich collection of real data and show that it results in good forecasting accuracy, especially for yearly series. Finally, while traditional statistical approaches underestimate the uncertainty around the forecasts, our approach results in upper coverage levels that are much closer to the nominal values.},

  abstract = {Embedding learning of categorical features (e.g. user/item IDs) is at the core of various recommendation models including matrix factorization and neural collaborative filtering. The standard approach creates an embedding table where each row represents a dedicated embedding vector for every unique feature value. However, this method fails to efficiently handle high-cardinality features and unseen feature values (e.g. new video ID) that are prevalent in real-world recommendation systems. In this paper, we propose an alternative embedding framework Deep Hash Embedding (DHE), replacing embedding tables by a deep embedding network to compute embeddings on the fly. DHE first encodes the feature value to a unique identifier vector with multiple hashing functions and transformations, and then applies a DNN to convert the identifier vector to an embedding. The encoding module is deterministic, non-learnable, and free of storage, while the embedding network is updated during the training time to learn embedding generation. Empirical results show that DHE achieves comparable AUC against the standard one-hot full embedding, with smaller model sizes. Our work sheds light on the design of DNN-based alternative embedding schemes for categorical features without using embedding table lookup.},

Here, we address the non-stationary spatio-temporal prediction problem on both densely and sparsely distributed sequences. We introduce a probabilistic approach that partitions the spatial domain into subregions and models the event arrivals in each region with interacting point-processes. Our algorithm can jointly learn the spatial partitioning and the interaction between these regions through a gradient-based optimization procedure.

Furthermore, we introduce a boosting algorithm based on random updates that is significantly faster than the conventional boosting methods and other variants of our proposed algorithms while achieving an enhanced performance gain. Hence, the random updates method is specifically applicable to the fast and high dimensional streaming data. Specifically, we investigate Newton Method-based and Stochastic Gradient Descent-based linear regression algorithms in a mixture-of-experts setting and provide several variants of these well-known adaptation methods.

In this work, a novel strategy for sales forecasting is proposed using Support Vector Regression (SVR) and hierarchical time series. We formalize three different hierarchical time series approaches: bottom-up SVR, top-down SVR, and middle-out SVR, and use them in a sales forecasting project for the Travel Retail Industry. Various hierarchical structures are proposed for the retail industry in order to achieve accurate product-level predictions. Experiments on these datasets demonstrate the virtues of SVR-based hierarchical time series in terms of predictive performance when compared with the traditional ARIMA and Holt-Winters approaches for this task.},

  abstract = {This paper resolves one of the longest standing basic problems in the streaming computational model. Namely, optimal construction of quantile sketches. An {$\epsilon$} approximate quantile sketch receives a stream of items x1, . . . , xn and allows one to approximate the rank of any query up to additive error {$\epsilon$}n with probability at least 1 - {$\delta$}. The rank of a query x is the number of stream items such that xi {$\leq$} x. The minimal sketch size required for this task is trivially at least 1/{$\epsilon$}. Felber and Ostrovsky obtain a O((1/{$\epsilon$}) log(1/{$\epsilon$})) space sketch for a fixed {$\delta$}. To date, no better upper or lower bounds were known even for randomly permuted streams or for approximating a specific quantile, e.g., the median. This paper obtains an O((1/{$\epsilon$}) log log(1/{$\delta$})) space sketch and a matching lower bound. This resolves the open problem and proves a qualitative gap between randomized and deterministic quantile sketching. One of our contributions is a novel representation and modification of the widely used merge-and-reduce construction. This subtle modification allows for an analysis which is both tight and extremely simple. Similar techniques should be useful for improving other sketching objectives and geometric coreset constructions.},

  abstract = {Online prediction has become one of the most essential tasks in many real-world applications. Two main characteristics of typical online prediction tasks include tabular input space and online data generation. Specifically, tabular input space indicates the existence of both sparse categorical features and dense numerical ones, while online data generation implies continuous task-generated data with potentially dynamic distribution. Consequently, effective learning with tabular input space as well as fast adaption to online data generation become two vital challenges for obtaining the online prediction model. Although Gradient Boosting Decision Tree (GBDT) and Neural Network (NN) have been widely used in practice, either of them yields their own weaknesses. Particularly, GBDT can hardly be adapted to dynamic online data generation, and it tends to be ineffective when facing sparse categorical features; NN, on the other hand, is quite difficult to achieve satisfactory performance when facing dense numerical features. In this paper, we propose a new learning framework, DeepGBM, which integrates the advantages of the both NN and GBDT by using two corresponding NN components: (1) CatNN, focusing on handling sparse categorical features. (2) GBDT2NN, focusing on dense numerical features with distilled knowledge from GBDT. Powered by these two components, DeepGBM can leverage both categorical and numerical features while retaining the ability of efficient online update. Comprehensive experiments on a variety of publicly available datasets have demonstrated that DeepGBM can outperform other well-recognized baselines in various online prediction tasks.},

A fast algorithm and code for this companion problem, also based on the above recurrence relations, are given. Finally, in the narrower, but common, domains of (i) trend detection and (ii) parameter estimation of a linear trend, users require, not the individual matrix elements, but simply their accumulated mean value. For this latter case we provide a yet faster \$\{\textbackslash cal O\}(N)\$ heuristic approximation that relies on a series of rank one matrices.

  abstract = {Granger causality is a widely-used criterion for analyzing interactions in large-scale networks. As most physical interactions are inherently nonlinear, we consider the problem of inferring the existence of pairwise Granger causality between nonlinearly interacting stochastic processes from their time series measurements. Our proposed approach relies on modeling the embedded nonlinearities in the measurements using a component-wise time series prediction model based on Statistical Recurrent Units (SRUs). We make a case that the network topology of Granger causal relations is directly inferrable from a structured sparse estimate of the internal parameters of the SRU networks trained to predict the processes\$'\$ time series measurements. We propose a variant of SRU, called economy-SRU, which, by design has considerably fewer trainable parameters, and therefore less prone to overfitting. The economy-SRU computes a low-dimensional sketch of its high-dimensional hidden state in the form of random projections to generate the feedback for its recurrent processing. Additionally, the internal weight parameters of the economy-SRU are strategically regularized in a group-wise manner to facilitate the proposed network in extracting meaningful predictive features that are highly time-localized to mimic real-world causal events. Extensive experiments are carried out to demonstrate that the proposed economy-SRU based time series prediction model outperforms the MLP, LSTM and attention-gated CNN-based time series models considered previously for inferring Granger causality.},

In recent times, deep learning methods (especially time series analysis) have performed outstandingly for various industrial problems, with better prediction than machine learning methods. Moreover, many researchers have used deep learning methods to predict financial time series with various models in recent years. In this paper, we will compare various deep learning models, such as multilayer perceptron (MLP), one-dimensional convolutional neural networks (1D CNN), stacked long short-term memory (stacked LSTM), attention networks, and weighted attention networks for financial time series prediction. In particular, attention LSTM is not only used for prediction, but also for visualizing intermediate outputs to analyze the reason of prediction; therefore, we will show an example for understanding the model prediction intuitively with attention vectors. In addition, we focus on time and factors, which lead to an easy understanding of why certain trends are predicted when accessing a given time series table. We also modify the loss functions of the attention models with weighted categorical cross entropy; our proposed model produces a 0.76 hit ratio, which is superior to those of other methods for predicting the trends of the KOSPI 200.},

In this paper, we propose the jackknife+-after-bootstrap (J+aB), a procedure for constructing a predictive interval, which uses only the available bootstrapped samples and their corresponding fitted models, and is therefore "free" in terms of the cost of model fitting. The J+aB offers a predictive coverage guarantee that holds with no assumptions on the distribution of the data, the nature of the fitted model, or the way in which the ensemble of models are aggregated---at worst, the failure rate of the predictive interval is inflated by a factor of 2. Our numerical experiments verify the coverage and accuracy of the resulting predictive intervals on real data.},

The method is also appropriate for non-stationary objectives and problems with very noisy and/or sparse gradients. The hyper-parameters have intuitive interpretations and typically require little tuning. Some connections to related algorithms, on which Adam was inspired, are discussed. We also analyze the theoretical convergence properties of the algorithm and provide a regret bound on the convergence rate that is comparable to the best known results under the online convex optimization framework. Empirical results demonstrate that Adam works well in practice and compares favorably to other stochastic optimization methods. Finally, we discuss AdaMax, a variant of Adam based on the infinity norm.},

The testing of the cycle prediction accuracy is performed for the last six cycles (from Solar Cycle 19 to 24) by sequentially shortening the observational data series that are used for prediction of a target cycle, and evaluating the prediction accuracy according to specified criteria.

  abstract = {Deep Learning has revolutionized vision via convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and natural language processing via recurrent neural networks (RNNs). However, success stories of Deep Learning with standard feed-forward neural networks (FNNs) are rare. FNNs that perform well are typically shallow and, therefore cannot exploit many levels of abstract representations. We introduce self-normalizing neural networks (SNNs) to enable high-level abstract representations. While batch normalization requires explicit normalization, neuron activations of SNNs automatically converge towards zero mean and unit variance. The activation function of SNNs are ``scaled exponential linear units'' (SELUs), which induce self-normalizing properties. Using the Banach fixed-point theorem, we prove that activations close to zero mean and unit variance that are propagated through many network layers will converge towards zero mean and unit variance \textemdash{} even under the presence of noise and perturbations. This convergence property of SNNs allows to (1) train deep networks with many layers, (2) employ strong regularization schemes, and (3) to make learning highly robust. Furthermore, for activations not close to unit variance, we prove an upper and lower bound on the variance, thus, vanishing and exploding gradients are impossible. We compared SNNs on (a) 121 tasks from the UCI machine learning repository, on (b) drug discovery benchmarks, and on (c) astronomy tasks with standard FNNs, and other machine learning methods such as random forests and support vector machines. For FNNs we considered (i) ReLU networks without normalization, (ii) batch normalization, (iii) layer normalization, (iv) weight normalization, (v) highway networks, and (vi) residual networks. SNNs significantly outperformed all competing FNN methods at 121 UCI tasks, outperformed all competing methods at the Tox21 dataset, and set a new record at an astronomy data set. The winning SNN architectures are often very deep. Implementations are available at: github.com/bioinf-jku/SNNs.},

  abstract = {Decision trees with binary splits are popularly constructed using Classification and Regression Trees (CART) methodology. For binary classification and regression models, this approach recursively divides the data into two near-homogenous daughter nodes according to a split point that maximizes the reduction in sum of squares error (the impurity) along a particular variable. This paper aims to study the bias and adaptive properties of regression trees constructed with CART. In doing so, we derive an interesting connection between the bias and the mean decrease in impurity (MDI) measure of variable importance\textemdash a tool widely used for model interpretability\textemdash defined as the sum of impurity reductions over all non-terminal nodes in the tree. In particular, we show that the probability content of a terminal subnode for a variable is small when the MDI for that variable is large and that this relationship is exponential\textemdash confirming theoretically that decision trees with CART have small bias and are adaptive to signal strength and direction. Finally, we apply these individual tree bounds to tree ensembles and show consistency of Breiman's random forests. The context is surprisingly general and applies to a wide variety of multivariable data generating distributions and regression functions. The main technical tool is an exact characterization of the conditional probability content of the daughter nodes arising from an optimal split, in terms of the partial dependence function and reduction in impurity.},

  abstract = {In predictive model development, gene expression data is associated with the unique challenge that the number of samples (n) is much smaller than the amount of features (p). This ``n\,{$\ll$}\,p'' property has prevented classification of gene expression data from deep learning techniques, which have been proved powerful under ``n\,{$>$}\,p'' scenarios in other application fields, such as image classification. Further, the sparsity of effective features with unknown correlation structures in gene expression profiles brings more challenges for classification tasks. To tackle these problems, we propose a newly developed classifier named Forest Deep Neural Network (fDNN), to integrate the deep neural network architecture with a supervised forest feature detector. Using this built-in feature detector, the method is able to learn sparse feature representations and feed the representations into a neural network to mitigate the overfitting problem. Simulation experiments and real data analyses using two RNA-seq expression datasets are conducted to evaluate fDNN's capability. The method is demonstrated a useful addition to current predictive models with better classification performance and more meaningful selected features compared to ordinary random forests and deep neural networks.},

To combine these two worlds, we introduce a stochastic and differentiable decision tree model, which steers the representation learning usually conducted in the initial layers of a (deep) convolutional network. Our model differs from conventional deep networks because a decision forest provides the final predictions and it differs from conventional decision forests since we propose a principled, joint and global optimization of split and leaf node parameters. We show experimental results on benchmark machine learning datasets like MNIST and ImageNet and find onpar or superior results when compared to state-of-the-art deep models. Most remarkably, we obtain Top5-Errors of only 7.84\%/6.38\% on ImageNet validation data when integrating our forests in a single-crop, single/seven model GoogLeNet architecture, respectively. Thus, even without any form of training data set augmentation we are improving on the 6.67\% error obtained by the best GoogLeNet architecture (7 models, 144 crops).},

We analyze protest dynamics in six countries of Latin America on a daily level, from November 2012 through August 2014, using multiple data sources that capture social, political and economic contexts within which civil unrest occurs. We use logistic regression models with Lasso to select a sparse feature set from our diverse datasets, in order to predict the probability of occurrence of civil unrest events in these countries. The models contain predictors extracted from social media sites (Twitter and blogs) and news sources, in addition to volume of requests to Tor, a widely-used anonymity network. Two political event databases and country-specific exchange rates are also used. Our forecasting models are evaluated using a Gold Standard Report (GSR), which is compiled by an independent group of social scientists and experts on Latin America. The experimental results, measured by F1-scores, are in the range 0.68 to 0.95, and demonstrate the efficacy of using a multi-source approach for predicting civil unrest. Case studies illustrate the insights into unrest events that are obtained with our methods.},

However, it is becoming increasingly relevant to many other areas, such as retailing, where at the very disaggregate level time series may be highly intermittent, but at more aggregate levels are likely to exhibit trends and seasonal patterns. The vast majority of intermittent demand forecasting methods are inappropriate for producing forecasts with such features. We propose using temporal hierarchies to produce forecasts that demonstrate these traits at the various aggregation levels, effectively informing the resulting intermittent forecasts of these patterns that are identifiable only at higher levels. We conduct an empirical evaluation on real data and demonstrate statistically significant gains for both point and quantile forecasts.},

In this exploratory research paper, we start from this premise and posit that all existing index structures can be replaced with other types of models, including deep-learning models, which we term learned indexes. We theoretically analyze under which conditions learned indexes outperform traditional index structures and describe the main challenges in designing learned index structures. Our initial results show that our learned indexes can have significant advantages over traditional indexes. More importantly, we believe that the idea of replacing core components of a data management system through learned models has far reaching implications for future systems designs and that this work provides just a glimpse of what might be possible.},

All these methods can be applied to various fields, including finance. This paper implements and analyzes the effectiveness of deep neural networks (DNN), gradient-boosted-trees (GBT), random forests (RAF), and several ensembles of these methods in the context of statistical arbitrage. Each model is trained on lagged returns of all stocks in the S\&P 500, after elimination of survivor bias. From 1992 to 2015, daily one-day-ahead trading signals are generated based on the probability forecast of a stock to outperform the general market. The highest k probabilities are converted into long and the lowest k probabilities into short positions, thus censoring the less certain middle part of the ranking. Empirical findings are promising. A simple, equal-weighted ensemble (ENS1) consisting of one deep neural network, one gradient-boosted tree, and one random forest produces out-of-sample returns exceeding 0.45 percent per day for k=10, prior to transaction costs. Irrespective of the fact that profits are declining in recent years, our findings pose a severe challenge to the semi-strong form of market efficiency.},

As a consequence, it is very challenging to come up with a more generic forecasting framework. Extensive hyperparameter optimization and ensemble architectures are common strategies to tackle this problem, however, this comes at the cost of high computational complexity. Instead of optimizing hyperparameters by training multiple models, we propose a method to estimate optimal hyperparameters directly from the characteristics of the time series at hand. To that end, we use Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for time series forecasting and determine a part of the network layout based on the time series' Fourier coefficients. Our approach significantly reduces the amount of required model configuration time and shows competitive performance on time series data across various domains. A comparison to popular, state of the art forecasting algorithms reveals further improvements in runtime and practicability.},

With this penalty term, IRNN can achieve similar performance to LSTM on language modeling, although adding the penalty term to the LSTM results in superior performance.

We perform an empirical investigation of various RNN regularizers, and find that zoneout gives significant performance improvements across tasks.

  abstract = {Embedding matrices are key components in neural natural language processing (NLP) models that are responsible to provide numerical representations of input tokens (i.e. words or subwords). In this paper, we analyze the impact and utility of such matrices in the context of neural machine translation (NMT). We show that detracting syntactic and semantic information from word embeddings and running NMT systems with random embeddings is not as damaging as it initially sounds. We also show how incorporating only a limited amount of task-specific knowledge from fully-trained embeddings can boost the performance NMT systems. Our findings demonstrate that in exchange for negligible deterioration in performance, any NMT model can be run with partially random embeddings. Working with such structures means a minimal memory requirement as there is no longer need to store large embedding tables, which is a significant gain in industrial and on-device settings. We evaluated our embeddings in translating English into German and French and achieved a 5.3x compression rate. Despite having a considerably smaller architecture, our models in some cases are even able to outperform state-of-the-art baselines.},

In order to improve their utility for smooth response surfaces, we study regression trees and random forests with linear aggregation functions. We introduce a new algorithm which finds the best axis-aligned split to fit optimal linear aggregation functions on the corresponding nodes and implement this method in the provably fastest way. This algorithm enables us to create more interpretable trees and obtain better predictive performance on a wide range of data sets. We also provide a software package that implements our algorithm. Applying the algorithm to several real-world data sets, we showcase its favorable performance in an extensive simulation study in terms of EMSE and demonstrate the improved interpretability of resulting estimators on a large real-world data set.},

However, for some problems such as initialization and local optima existing in applications, the improvement of ANNs is, and still will be the most interesting study for not only time series forecasting but also other intelligent computing fields. In this study, we propose a method for time series prediction using Hinton and Salakhutdinov׳s deep belief nets (DBN) which are probabilistic generative neural network composed by multiple layers of restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM). We use a 3-layer deep network of RBMs to capture the feature of input space of time series data, and after pretraining of RBMs using their energy functions, gradient descent training, i.e., back-propagation learning algorithm is used for fine-tuning connection weights between ``visible layers'' and ``hidden layers'' of RBMs. To decide the sizes of neural networks and the learning rates, Kennedy and Eberhart׳s particle swarm optimization (PSO) is adopted during the training processes. Furthermore, ``trend removal'', a preprocessing to the original data, is also approached in the forecasting experiment using CATS benchmark data. Additionally, approximating and short-term prediction of chaotic time series such as Lorenz chaos and logistic map were also applied by the proposed method.},

The proposed method uses the entropy regularized optimal transport between empirical measures defined on data instances and features in order to obtain an estimated joint probability density function represented by the optimal coupling matrix. This matrix is further factorized to obtain the induced row and columns partitions using multiscale representations approach. To justify our method theoretically, we show how the solution of the regularized optimal transport can be seen from the variational inference perspective thus motivating its use for co-clustering. The algorithm derived for the proposed method and its kernelized version based on the notion of Gromov-Wasserstein distance are fast, accurate and can determine automatically the number of both row and column clusters.

To fill this scientific gap, we propose four different deep learning models for predicting electricity prices and we show how they lead to improvements in predictive accuracy. In addition, we also consider that, despite the large number of proposed methods for predicting electricity prices, an extensive benchmark is still missing. To tackle that, we compare and analyze the accuracy of 27 common approaches for electricity price forecasting. Based on the benchmark results, we show how the proposed deep learning models outperform the state-of-the-art methods and obtain results that are statistically significant. Finally, using the same results, we also show that: (i) machine learning methods yield, in general, a better accuracy than statistical models; (ii) moving average terms do not improve the predictive accuracy; (iii) hybrid models do not outperform their simpler counterparts.},

We compare our approach against other anomaly detection systems on real and synthetic data with varying time-series characteristics. We found that our framework allows for 50-60\% improvement in precision and recall for a variety of use-cases. Both the data and the framework are being open-sourced.

  abstract = {Classication and Regression Trees (CART) are a method of structured prediction widely used in machine learning. Favored for their robustness to non-linear relationships and interpretability (James, Witten, Hastie, \&amp; Tibshirani, 2013), they have seen continued application since their broad introduction in 1984 (Breiman, Friedman, Olshen, \&amp; Stone, 1984). The shortcomings of a single-tree model, especially overfitting and lack of competitiveness compared to other machine learning methods, have been overcome through advances in bagging, pruning, and boosting (James et al., 2013). Decision trees are fitted in a top-down, greedy fashion because non-greedy fitting is computationally intractable. While this leads to efficient computation, using top-down, greedy estimates can produce suboptimal models. To overcome this suboptimality I propose a semi-greedy method of decision tree construction. First, I reformulate the problem based on the work of Norouzi et. al. (2015)(Norouzi, Collins, Johnson, Fleet, \&amp; Kohli, 2015), and use an algorithm which optimizes the split functions at all levels of the tree jointly, based on a global objective. This algorithm is parameterized by a single scalar for which I propose a bound. Second, I propose a dimensionality reduction step for cases when the semi-greedy algorithm becomes intractable. In the five datasets tested (Breast Cancer Wisconsin, Banknotes Authentication, Haberman Survival Data, Blood Transfusion Data, Fertility Data), the algorithm produces higher accuracy than two existing greedy tree packages in R (rpart, tree). And, it is computationally tractable for low-width datasets (approximately 8 features or fewer). For higher order problems, I propose a preprocessing step which reduces the higher-width data to a more tractable subset. I show that a dimensionally reduced space, processed using the semi-greedy algorithm, outperforms the greedy methods (rpart, trees) trained with both full and reduced data sets.},

  abstract = {Learning from visual observations is a fundamental yet challenging problem in reinforcement learning (RL). Although algorithmic advancements combined with convolutional neural networks have proved to be a recipe for success, current methods are still lacking on two fronts: (a) sample efficiency of learning and (b) generalization to new environments. To this end, we present RAD: Reinforcement Learning with Augmented Data, a simple plug-and-play module that can enhance any RL algorithm. We show that data augmentations such as random crop, color jitter, patch cutout, and random convolutions can enable simple RL algorithms to match and even outperform complex state-of-the-art methods across common benchmarks in terms of data-efficiency, generalization, and wall-clock speed. We find that data diversity alone can make agents focus on meaningful information from high-dimensional observations without any changes to the reinforcement learning method. On the DeepMind Control Suite, we show that RAD is state-of-the-art in terms of data-efficiency and performance across 15 environments. We further demonstrate that RAD can significantly improve the test-time generalization on several OpenAI ProcGen benchmarks. Finally, our customized data augmentation modules enable faster wall-clock speed compared to competing RL techniques. Our RAD module and training code are available at https://www.github.com/MishaLaskin/rad.},

For example, is it possible to learn a face detector using only unlabeled images? To answer this, we train a 9layered locally connected sparse autoencoder with pooling and local contrast normalization on a large dataset of images (the model has 1 billion connections, the dataset has 10 million 200x200 pixel images downloaded from the Internet). We train this network using model parallelism and asynchronous SGD on a cluster with 1,000 machines (16,000 cores) for three days. Contrary to what appears to be a widely-held intuition, our experimental results reveal that it is possible to train a face detector without having to label images as containing a face or not. Control experiments show that this feature detector is robust not only to translation but also to scaling and out-of-plane rotation. We also find that the same network is sensitive to other high-level concepts such as cat faces and human bodies. Starting with these learned features, we trained our network to obtain 15.8\% accuracy in recognizing 22,000 object categories from ImageNet, a leap of 70\% relative improvement over the previous state-of-the-art.},

Long-term histories are also used to consider periodicity and seasonality patterns as time series data. In this study, we propose an efficient architecture, Temporal-Guided Network (TGNet), which utilizes graph networks and temporal-guided embedding. Graph networks extract invariant features to permutations of adjacent regions instead of convolutional layers. Temporal-guided embedding explicitly learns temporal contexts from training data and is substituted for the input of long-term histories from days/weeks ago. TGNet learns an autoregressive model, conditioned on temporal contexts of forecasting targets from temporal-guided embedding. Finally, our model achieves competitive performances with other baselines on three spatiotemporal demand dataset from real-world, but the number of trainable parameters is about 20 times smaller than a state-of-the-art baseline. We also show that temporal-guided embedding learns temporal contexts as intended and TGNet has robust forecasting performances even to atypical event situations.},

In this paper, we address this problem for non-stationary time series, which is very challenging yet crucially important. We introduce the STRIPE model for representing structured diversity based on shape and time features, ensuring both probable predictions while being sharp and accurate. STRIPE is agnostic to the forecasting model, and we equip it with a diversification mechanism relying on determinantal point processes (DPP). We introduce two DPP kernels for modelling diverse trajectories in terms of shape and time, which are both differentiable and proved to be positive semi-definite. To have an explicit control on the diversity structure, we also design an iterative sampling mechanism to disentangle shape and time representations in the latent space. Experiments carried out on synthetic datasets show that STRIPE significantly outperforms baseline methods for representing diversity, while maintaining accuracy of the forecasting model. We also highlight the relevance of the iterative sampling scheme and the importance to use different criteria for measuring quality and diversity. Finally, experiments on real datasets illustrate that STRIPE is able to outperform state-of-the-art probabilistic forecasting approaches in the best sample prediction.},

The representation is learned to capture the variation in the environment generated by the agent's actions; this kind of representation is particularly suitable for robotics and control scenarios. In particular, the low dimension characteristic of the representation helps to overcome the curse of dimensionality, provides easier interpretation and utilization by humans and can help improve performance and speed in policy learning algorithms such as reinforcement learning. This survey aims at covering the state-of-the-art on state representation learning in the most recent years. It reviews different SRL methods that involve interaction with the environment, their implementations and their applications in robotics control tasks (simulated or real). In particular, it highlights how generic learning objectives are differently exploited in the reviewed algorithms. Finally, it discusses evaluation methods to assess the representation learned and summarizes current and future lines of research.},

Importantly, the shape and the size of an area are dynamically determined via learning, which enables a model to attend to information with varying granularity. Area attention can easily work with existing model architectures such as multi-head attention for simultaneously attending to multiple areas in the memory. We evaluate area attention on two tasks: neural machine translation (both character and token-level) and image captioning, and improve upon strong (state-of-the-art) baselines in all the cases. These improvements are obtainable with a basic form of area attention that is parameter free.},

It is of high interest in financial applications to be able to capture the underlying joint dynamics of these two quantities.

However, in continual and sequential learning scenarios in which the models are trained using different data with various distributions, neural networks tend to forget the previously learned knowledge. This phenomenon is often referred to as catastrophic forgetting. The catastrophic forgetting is an inevitable problem in continual learning models for dynamic environments. To address this issue, we propose a method, called Continual Bayesian Learning Networks (CBLN), which enables the networks to allocate additional resources to adapt to new tasks without forgetting the previously learned tasks. Using a Bayesian Neural Network, CBLN maintains a mixture of Gaussian posterior distributions that are associated with different tasks. The proposed method tries to optimise the number of resources that are needed to learn each task and avoids an exponential increase in the number of resources that are involved in learning multiple tasks. The proposed method does not need to access the past training data and can choose suitable weights to classify the data points during the test time automatically based on an uncertainty criterion. We have evaluated our method on the MNIST and UCR time-series datasets. The evaluation results show that our method can address the catastrophic forgetting problem at a promising rate compared to the state-of-the-art models.},

Despite the fact that the LSTMs can help to capture long-term dependencies, its ability to pay different degree of attention on sub-window feature within multiple time-steps is insufficient. To address this issue, an evolutionary attention-based LSTM training with competitive random search is proposed for multivariate time series prediction. By transferring shared parameters, an evolutionary attention learning approach is introduced to the LSTMs model. Thus, like that for biological evolution, the pattern for importance-based attention sampling can be confirmed during temporal relationship mining. To refrain from being trapped into partial optimization like traditional gradient-based methods, an evolutionary computation inspired competitive random search method is proposed, which can well configure the parameters in the attention layer. Experimental results have illustrated that the proposed model can achieve competetive prediction performance compared with other baseline methods.},

  abstract = {Life expectancy has been increasing sharply around the globe since the second half of the 20th century. Mortality modeling and forecasting have therefore attracted increasing attention from various areas, such as the public pension systems, commercial insurance sectors, as well as actuarial, demographic and epidemiological research. Compared to the aggregate mortality experience, cause-specific mortality rates contain more detailed information, and can help us better understand the ongoing mortality improvements. However, when conducting cause-of-death mortality modeling, it is important to ensure coherence in the forecasts. That is, the forecasts of cause-specific mortality rates should add up to the forecasts of the aggregate mortality rates. In this paper, we propose a novel forecast reconciliation approach to achieve this goal. We use the age-specific mortality experience in the U.S. during 1970\textendash 2015 as a case study. Seven major causes of death are considered in this paper. By incorporating both the disaggregate cause-specific data and the aggregate total-level data, we achieve better forecasting results at both levels and coherence across forecasts. Moreover, we perform a cluster analysis on the cause-specific mortality data. It is shown that combining mortality experience from causes with similar mortality patterns can provide additional useful information, and thus further improve forecast accuracy. Finally, based on the proposed reconciliation approach, we conduct a scenario-based analysis to project future mortality rates under the assumption of certain causes being eliminated.},

In this work, we study feature learning techniques for graph-structured inputs. Our starting point is previous work on Graph Neural Networks (Scarselli et al., 2009), which we modify to use gated recurrent units and modern optimization techniques and then extend to output sequences. The result is a flexible and broadly useful class of neural network models that has favorable inductive biases relative to purely sequence-based models (e.g., LSTMs) when the problem is graph-structured. We demonstrate the capabilities on some simple AI (bAbI) and graph algorithm learning tasks. We then show it achieves state-of-the-art performance on a problem from program verification, in which subgraphs need to be described as abstract data structures.},

  abstract = {Nonlinear dynamic volatility has been observed in many financial time series. The recently proposed quantile periodogram offers an alternative way to examine this phenomena in the frequency domain. The quantile periodogram is constructed from trigonometric quantile regression of time series data at different frequencies and quantile levels. It is a useful tool for quantile-frequency analysis (QFA) of nonlinear serial dependence. This paper introduces a number of spectral divergence metrics based on the quantile periodogram for diagnostic checks of financial time series models and model-based discriminant analysis. The parametric bootstrapping technique is employed to compute the \$p\$-values of the metrics. The usefulness of the proposed method is demonstrated empirically by a case study using the daily log returns of the S\textbackslash\&P 500 index over three periods of time together with their GARCH-type models. The results show that the QFA method is able to provide additional insights into the goodness of fit of these financial time series models that may have been missed by conventional tests. The results also show that the QFA method offers a more informative way of discriminant analysis for detecting regime changes in time series.},

Specifically, this is an early attempt to apply deep learning techniques to crude oil forecasting, and to extract hidden patterns within online news media using a convolutional neural network (CNN). While the news-text sentiment features and the features extracted by the CNN model reveal significant relationships with the price change, they need to be grouped according to their topics in the price forecasting in order to obtain a greater forecasting accuracy. This study further proposes a feature grouping method based on the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic model for distinguishing effects from various online news topics. Optimized input variable combination is constructed using lag order selection and feature selection methods. Our empirical results suggest that the proposed topic-sentiment synthesis forecasting models perform better than the older benchmark models. In addition, text features and financial features are shown to be complementary in producing more accurate crude oil price forecasts.},

Models trained with early stopping often provide relatively accurate predictions, but they generally still lack precise statistical guarantees unless they are further calibrated using independent hold-out data. This paper addresses the above limitation with conformalized early stopping: a novel method that combines early stopping with conformal calibration while efficiently recycling the same hold-out data. This leads to models that are both accurate and able to provide exact predictive inferences without multiple data splits nor overly conservative adjustments. Practical implementations are developed for different learning tasks -- outlier detection, multi-class classification, regression -- and their competitive performance is demonstrated on real data.},

These sensors generate multiple geo-sensory time series, with spatial correlations between their readings. Forecasting geo-sensory time series is of great importance yet very challenging as it is affected by many complex factors, i.e., dynamic spatio-temporal correlations and external factors. In this paper, we predict the readings of a geo-sensor over several future hours by using a multi-level attention-based recurrent neural network that considers multiple sensors' readings, meteorological data, and spatial data. More specifically, our model consists of two major parts: 1) a multi-level attention mechanism to model the dynamic spatio-temporal dependencies. 2) a general fusion module to incorporate the external factors from different domains. Experiments on two types of real-world datasets, viz., air quality data and water quality data, demonstrate that our method outperforms nine baseline methods.},

Popular techniques involve content-based (CB) models and collaborative filtering (CF) approaches. In this paper, we deal with a very important problem in RSs: The cold start problem. This problem is related to recommendations for novel users or new items. In case of new users, the system does not have information about their preferences in order to make recommendations. We propose a model where widely known classification algorithms in combination with similarity techniques and prediction mechanisms provide the necessary means for retrieving recommendations. The proposed approach incorporates classification methods in a pure CF system while the use of demographic data help for the identification of other users with similar behavior. Our experiments show the performance of the proposed system through a large number of experiments. We adopt the widely known dataset provided by the GroupLens research group. We reveal the advantages of the proposed solution by providing satisfactory numerical results in different experimental scenarios.},

However, it is difficult to accelerate the training and inference of CNNs based on traditional Fourier domain acceleration frameworks because Fourier domain training and inference are related to many complicated factors, such as the architecture of Fourier domain propagation passes, the representation of the activation function and the design of downsampling operations. A conceptually intuitive, useful and general Fourier domain acceleration framework for CNNs is proposed in this paper. Taking the proposed Fourier domain rectified linear unit (FReLU) as an activation function and the proposed Fourier domain pooling function (FPool) as a downsampling function, a Fourier domain acceleration framework is established for CNNs, and the inverse activation function (FReLU-1) and inverse downsampling function (FPool-1) are further obtained for the backward propagation pass. Furthermore, a block decomposition pipeline is integrated into the Fourier domain forward/backward propagation passes of CNNs to accelerate the training and inference of CNNs. The results show that the proposed acceleration framework can accelerate the training and inference of CNNs by a significant factor without reducing the recognition precision.},

Learning and forecasting the trend in time series data play an important role in many real applications, ranging from resource allocation in data centers, load schedule in smart grid, and so on. Inspired by the recent successes of neural networks, in this paper we propose TreNet, a novel end-toend hybrid neural network to learn local and global contextual features for predicting the trend of time series. TreNet leverages convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to extract salient features from local raw data of time series. Meanwhile, considering the long-range dependency existing in the sequence of historical trends, TreNet uses a long-short term memory recurrent neural network (LSTM) to capture such dependency. Then, a feature fusion layer is to learn joint representation for predicting the trend. TreNet demonstrates its effectiveness by outperforming CNN, LSTM, the cascade of CNN and LSTM, Hidden Markov Model based method and various kernel based baselines on real datasets.},

  abstract = {Crucial for building trust in deep learning models for critical real-world applications is efficient and theoretically sound uncertainty quantification, a task that continues to be challenging. Useful uncertainty information is expected to have two key properties: It should be valid (guaranteeing coverage) and discriminative (more uncertain when the expected risk is high). Moreover, when combined with deep learning (DL) methods, it should be scalable and affect the DL model performance minimally. Most existing Bayesian methods lack frequentist coverage guarantees and usually affect model performance. The few available frequentist methods are rarely discriminative and/or violate coverage guarantees due to unrealistic assumptions. Moreover, many methods are expensive or require substantial modifications to the base neural network. Building upon recent advances in conformal prediction [13, 33] and leveraging the classical idea of kernel regression, we propose Locally Valid and Discriminative prediction intervals (LVD), a simple, efficient, and lightweight method to construct discriminative prediction intervals (PIs) for almost any DL model. With no assumptions on the data distribution, such PIs also offer finite-sample local coverage guarantees (contrasted to the simpler marginal coverage). We empirically verify, using diverse datasets, that besides being the only locally valid method for DL, LVD also exceeds or matches the performance (including coverage rate and prediction accuracy) of existing uncertainty quantification methods, while offering additional benefits in scalability and flexibility.},

We propose a hierarchical attention-based temporal convolutional network (HA-TCN) for myotonic dystrohpy diagnosis from handgrip time series data, and introduce mechanisms that enable model explainability. We compare the performance of the HA-TCN model against that of benchmark TCN models, LSTM models with and without attention mechanisms, and SVM approaches with handcrafted features. In terms of classification accuracy and F1 score, we found all deep learning models have similar levels of performance, and they all outperform SVM. Further, the HA-TCN model outperforms its TCN counterpart with regards to computational efficiency regardless of network depth, and in terms of performance particularly when the number of hidden layers is small. Lastly, HA-TCN models can consistently identify relevant time series segments in the relaxation phase of the handgrip time series, and exhibit increased robustness to noise when compared to attention-based LSTM models.},

  abstract = {Multivariate time series forecasting recently has received extensive attention with its wide application in finance, transportation, environment, and so on. However, few of the currently developed models have considered the impact of noise on prediction. Since multivariate time series contains multiple subsequences with strong nonlinear fluctuations, it is also difficult to obtain satisfactory prediction results. In this paper, aiming at improving prediction performance, we have proposed a novel ensemble three-phase model called adaptive noise reducer-stacked auto-encoder-validating-AdaBoost-based long short-term memory (ANR-SAE-VALSTM). We start with an introduction of a novel ANR for time series noise elimination. The SAEs are then used to extract features from the de-noised multivariate time series. Finally, we feed the de-noised features into the VALSTM to train an ensemble over-fitting prevention predictor. The proposed model is employed on the Beijing PM2.5 dataset and GEFCom2014 Electricity Price dataset. Compared with other popular models, the proposed model has achieved the best prediction performance in all prediction horizons. In addition, a careful ablation study is conducted to demonstrate the efficiency of our model design.},

  abstract = {Stock market prediction is of great importance for financial analysis. Traditionally, many studies only use the news or numerical data for the stock market prediction. In the recent years, in order to explore their complementary, some studies have been conducted to equally treat dual sources of information. However, numerical data often play a much more important role compared with the news. In addition, the existing simple combination cannot exploit their complementarity. In this paper, we propose a numerical-based attention (NBA) method for dual sources stock market prediction. Our major contributions are summarized as follows. First, we propose an attention-based method to effectively exploit the complementarity between news and numerical data in predicting the stock prices. The stock trend information hidden in the news is transformed into the importance distribution of numerical data. Consequently, the news is encoded to guide the selection of numerical data. Our method can effectively filter the noise and make full use of the trend information in news. Then, in order to evaluate our NBA model, we collect news corpus and numerical data to build three datasets from two sources: the China Security Index 300 (CSI300) and the Standard \& Poor's 500 (S\&P500). Extensive experiments are conducted, showing that our NBA is superior to previous models in dual sources stock price prediction.},

GBM routinely features as a leading algorithm in machine learning competitions such as Kaggle and the KDDCup. In this work, we propose Accelerated Gradient Boosting Machine (AGBM) by incorporating Nesterov's acceleration techniques into the design of GBM. The difficulty in accelerating GBM lies in the fact that weak (inexact) learners are commonly used, and therefore the errors can accumulate in the momentum term. To overcome it, we design a ``corrected pseudo residual'' and fit best weak learner to this corrected pseudo residual, in order to perform the z-update. Thus, we are able to derive novel computational guarantees for AGBM. This is the first GBM type of algorithm with theoretically-justified accelerated convergence rate. Finally we demonstrate with a number of numerical experiments the effectiveness of AGBM over conventional GBM in obtaining a model with good training and/or testing data fidelity.},

However, because of their intrinsic complexity, most deep learning methods are largely treated as black box tools with little interpretability. Even though recent attempts have been made to facilitate the interpretability of deep neural networks (DNNs), existing methods are susceptible to noise and lack of robustness. Therefore, scientists are justifiably cautious about the reproducibility of the discoveries, which is often related to the interpretability of the underlying statistical models. In this paper, we describe a method to increase the interpretability and reproducibility of DNNs by incorporating the idea of feature selection with controlled error rate. By designing a new DNN architecture and integrating it with the recently proposed knockoffs framework, we perform feature selection with a controlled error rate, while maintaining high power. This new method, DeepPINK (Deep feature selection using Paired-Input Nonlinear Knockoffs), is applied to both simulated and real data sets to demonstrate its empirical utility.},

  abstract = {Weather Forecasting is an attractive challengeable task due to its influence on human life and complexity in atmospheric motion. Supported by massive historical observed time series data, the task is suitable for data-driven approaches, especially deep neural networks. Recently, the Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) based methods have achieved excellent performance for spatio-temporal forecasting. However, the canonical GNNs-based methods only individually model the local graph of meteorological variables per station or the global graph of whole stations, lacking information interaction between meteorological variables in different stations. In this paper, we propose a novel Hierarchical Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Network (HiSTGNN) to model cross-regional spatio-temporal correlations among meteorological variables in multiple stations. An adaptive graph learning layer and spatial graph convolution are employed to construct self-learning graph and study hidden dependency among nodes of variable-level and station-level graph. For capturing temporal pattern, the dilated inception as the backbone of gate temporal convolution is designed to model long and various meteorological trends. Moreover, a dynamic interaction learning is proposed to build bidirectional information passing in hierarchical graph. Experimental results on three real-world meteorological datasets demonstrate the superior performance of HiSTGNN beyond 7 baselines and it reduces the errors by 4.2\% to 11.6\% especially compared to state-of-the-art weather forecasting method.},

  abstract = {Machine Learning (ML) methods have been proposed in the academic literature as alternatives to statistical ones for time series forecasting. Yet, scant evidence is available about their relative performance in terms of accuracy and computational requirements. The purpose of this paper is to evaluate such performance across multiple forecasting horizons using a large subset of 1045 monthly time series used in the M3 Competition. After comparing the post-sample accuracy of popular ML methods with that of eight traditional statistical ones, we found that the former are dominated across both accuracy measures used and for all forecasting horizons examined. Moreover, we observed that their computational requirements are considerably greater than those of statistical methods. The paper discusses the results, explains why the accuracy of ML models is below that of statistical ones and proposes some possible ways forward. The empirical results found in our research stress the need for objective and unbiased ways to test the performance of forecasting methods that can be achieved through sizable and open competitions allowing meaningful comparisons and definite conclusions.},

  abstract = {For many practical, high-risk applications, it is essential to quantify uncertainty in a model's predictions to avoid costly mistakes. While predictive uncertainty is widely studied for neural networks, the topic seems to be under-explored for models based on gradient boosting. However, gradient boosting often achieves state-ofthe-art results on tabular data. This work examines a probabilistic ensemblebased framework for deriving uncertainty estimates in the predictions of gradient boosting classification and regression models. We conducted experiments on a range of synthetic and real datasets and investigated the applicability of ensemble approaches to gradient boosting models that are themselves ensembles of decision trees. Our analysis shows that ensembles of gradient boosting models successfully detect anomalous inputs while having limited ability to improve the predicted total uncertainty. Importantly, we also propose a concept of a virtual ensemble to get the benefits of an ensemble via only one gradient boosting model, which significantly reduces complexity.},

  abstract = {Wide area networking infrastructures (WANs), particularly science and research WANs, are the backbone for moving large volumes of scientific data between experimental facilities and data centers. With demands growing at exponential rates, these networks are struggling to cope with large data volumes, real-time responses, and overall network performance. Network operators are increasingly looking for innovative ways to manage the limited underlying network resources. Forecasting network traffic is a critical capability for proactive resource management, congestion mitigation, and dedicated transfer provisioning. To this end, we propose a nonautoregressive graph-based neural network for multistep network traffic forecasting. Specifically, we develop a dynamic variant of diffusion convolutional recurrent neural networks to forecast traffic in research WANs. We evaluate the efficacy of our approach on real traffic from ESnet, the U.S. Department of Energy's dedicated science network. Our results show that compared to classical forecasting methods, our approach explicitly learns the dynamic nature of spatiotemporal traffic patterns, showing significant improvements in forecasting accuracy. Our technique can surpass existing statistical and deep learning approaches by achieving approximately 20\% mean absolute percentage error for multiple hours of forecasts despite dynamic network traffic settings.}

  abstract = {In this paper, we propose a machine learning approach for forecasting hierarchical time series. When dealing with hierarchical time series, apart from generating accurate forecasts, one needs to select a suitable method for producing reconciled forecasts. Forecast reconciliation is the process of adjusting forecasts to make them coherent across the hierarchy. In literature, coherence is often enforced by using a post-processing technique on the base forecasts produced by suitable time series forecasting methods. On the contrary, our idea is to use a deep neural network to directly produce accurate and reconciled forecasts. We exploit the ability of a deep neural network to extract information capturing the structure of the hierarchy. We impose the reconciliation at training time by minimizing a customized loss function. In many practical applications, besides time series data, hierarchical time series include explanatory variables that are beneficial for increasing the forecasting accuracy. Exploiting this further information, our approach links the relationship between time series features extracted at any level of the hierarchy and the explanatory variables into an end-to-end neural network providing accurate and reconciled point forecasts. The effectiveness of the approach is validated on three real-world datasets, where our method outperforms state-of-the-art competitors in hierarchical forecasting.},

Speci cally, we use large-scale anonymized transaction records to model consumer spending and forecast future purchases, based on which we generate data-driven, personalized coupons. Our proposed model RUSH!

We design a cost-bene t framework that facilitates systematic evaluation in terms of our application, and show that RUSH! provides higher expected value than various baselines that do not jointly model time and category information.},

An irregular time series can be generated or measured with a purely deterministic equation of motion in nonlinear and chaotic systems. This paper presents an adaptive state-space particle filtering (PF)-based trained radial basis function (RBF) network for chaotic and nonstationary observation\textendash prediction. The recursive Bayesian filtering algorithm, which uses the particle representation of density function, is adopted to accomplish nonlinear and non-Gaussian state estimation and achieve improved convergence rate and quality of solution. Four sampling importance resampling approaches, namely, multinomial, systematic, stratified, and residual resampling methods, are considered to resolve weight degeneracy. The effectiveness of our proposed methods is investigated using two chaotic time series and three measurement datasets, including the Mackey\textendash Glass time series, Rossler time series, monthly Lake Erie levels, monthly water usage series, and SML2010 data set. The performances are evaluated through an extensive simulation by computing the average mean square error, mean absolute percentage error, and average relative variance metrics. Simulation results show that the proposed PF-based RBF structure can provide more effective and accurate prediction performances compared with the conventional gradient descent, extended Kalman filter (EKF), and decoupled EKF algorithms (DEKF).},

We show on some controlled synthetic data that this algorithm meets empirically our initial objectives. We finally evaluate it on real data, in the context of some on-line handwritten signature authentication benchmarks. On the three evaluated tasks, our approach based on the separation of signature shape and associated temporal patterns is positioned slightly above the current state of the art demonstrating the applicative benefit of this separating problem.},

  abstract = {1 Introduction The analysis and modeling of time-series data is an important area of research for many communities. In this paper, our goal is to identify models for continuousvalued time-series data that are useful for data mining in that they (1) can be learned eficiently from data, (2) support accurate predictions, and (3) are easy to interpret. To these ends, we describe an interpretable class of models that we call AutoRegressive Tree models, or ART models, that are a generalization of standard autoregressive (AR) models. We describe learning methods for ART models and compare these methods to those for alternative models. Our experiments, performed on 2,494 time-series data sets from the International Institute of Forecasters, demonstrate that ART models provide superior predictive accuracy. We concentrate on the problem of modeling the evolution of values of a continuous variable over time; that is, we model a univariate time series. The generalization to multivariate time-series analysis is straightforward and is discussed in Section 6.},

  abstract = {Decision tree (and its extensions such as Gradient Boosting Decision Trees and Random Forest) is a widely used machine learning algorithm, due to its practical effectiveness and model interpretability. With the emergence of big data, there is an increasing need to parallelize the training process of decision tree. However, most existing attempts along this line suffer from high communication costs. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm, called Parallel Voting Decision Tree (PV-Tree), to tackle this challenge. After partitioning the training data onto a number of (e.g., M ) machines, this algorithm performs both local voting and global voting in each iteration. For local voting, the top-k attributes are selected from each machine according to its local data. Then, globally top-2k attributes are determined by a majority voting among these local candidates. Finally, the full-grained histograms of the globally top-2k attributes are collected from local machines in order to identify the best (most informative) attribute and its split point. PV-Tree can achieve a very low communication cost (independent of the total number of attributes) and thus can scale out very well. Furthermore, theoretical analysis shows that this algorithm can learn a near optimal decision tree, since it can find the best attribute with a large probability. Our experiments on real-world datasets show that PV-Tree significantly outperforms the existing parallel decision tree algorithms in the trade-off between accuracy and efficiency.},

  abstract = {Interest in predicting multivariate probability distributions is growing due to the increasing availability of rich datasets and computational developments. Scoring functions enable the comparison of forecast accuracy, and can potentially be used for estimation. A scoring function for multivariate distributions that has gained some popularity is the energy score. This is a generalization of the continuous ranked probability score (CRPS), which is widely used for univariate distributions. A little-known, alternative generalization is the multivariate CRPS (MCRPS). We propose a theoretical framework for scoring functions for multivariate distributions, which encompasses the energy score and MCRPS, as well as the quadratic score, which has also received little attention. We demonstrate how this framework can be used to generate new scores. For univariate distributions, it is well-established that the CRPS can be expressed as the integral over a quantile score. We show that, in a similar way, scoring functions for multivariate distributions can be "disintegrated" to obtain scoring functions for level sets. Using this, we present scoring functions for different types of level set, including those for densities and cumulative distributions. To compute the scoring functions, we propose a simple numerical algorithm. We illustrate our proposals using simulated and stock returns data.},

In response, recent work in meta-learning proposes training a meta-learner on a distribution of similar tasks, in the hopes of generalization to novel but related tasks by learning a high-level strategy that captures the essence of the problem it is asked to solve. However, many recent meta-learning approaches are extensively hand-designed, either using architectures specialized to a particular application, or hard-coding algorithmic components that constrain how the meta-learner solves the task. We propose a class of simple and generic meta-learner architectures that use a novel combination of temporal convolutions and soft attention; the former to aggregate information from past experience and the latter to pinpoint specific pieces of information. In the most extensive set of meta-learning experiments to date, we evaluate the resulting Simple Neural AttentIve Learner (or SNAIL) on several heavily-benchmarked tasks. On all tasks, in both supervised and reinforcement learning, SNAIL attains state-of-the-art performance by significant margins.},

We investigate a city-scale traffic dataset with 14 weeks of speed observations collected every 15 minutes over 1098 segments in the hypercenter of Los Angeles, California. We look at a variety of machine learning and deep learning predictors for link-based predictions, and investigate ways to make such predictors scale up for larger areas, with brute force, clustering, and model design approaches. In particular we propose a novel deep learning spatio-temporal predictor inspired from recent works on recommender systems. We discuss the potential of including spatio-temporal features into the predictors, and conclude that modelling such features can be helpful for long-term predictions, while simpler predictors achieve very satisfactory performance for link-based and short-term forecasting. The trade-off is discussed not only in terms of prediction accuracy vs prediction horizon but also in terms of training time and model sizing.},

The AR-MDN can be trained end-to-end without the need for additional supervision. We experiment on a dataset of an year's worth of data over tens-of-thousands of products from Flipkart. The proposed architecture yields a significant improvement in forecasting accuracy when compared with existing alternatives.},

  abstract = {In this paper we include dependency structures for electricity price forecasting and forecasting evaluation. We work with off-peak and peak time series from the German-Austrian day-ahead price, hence we analyze bivariate data. We first estimate the mean of the two time series, and then in a second step we estimate the residuals. The mean equation is estimated by OLS and elastic net and the residuals are estimated by maximum likelihood. Our contribution is to include a bivariate jump component on a mean reverting jump diffusion model in the residuals. The models' forecasts are evaluated using four different criteria, including the energy score to measure whether the correlation structure between the time series is properly included or not. In the results it is observed that the models with bivariate jumps provide better results with the energy score, which means that it is important to consider this structure in order to properly forecast correlated time series.},

During the learning phase, starting from the root network node, DDN automatically builds a network that splits the data into disjoint clusters of classes which would be handled by the subsequent expert networks. This results in a tree-like structured network driven by the data. The proposed method provides an insight into the data by identifying the group of classes that are hard to classify and require more attention when compared to others. DDN also has the ability to make early decisions thus making it suitable for timesensitive applications. We validate DDN on two publicly available benchmark datasets: CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 and it yields state-of-the-art classification performance on both the datasets. The proposed algorithm has no limitations to be applied to any generic classification problems.},

We define a differentiable loss function that represents the partitioning objective. Unlike baselines that redo the optimization per graph, GAP is capable of generalization, allowing us to train models that produce performant partitions at inference time, even on unseen graphs. Furthermore, because we learn the representation of the graph while jointly optimizing for the partitioning loss function, GAP can be easily tuned for a variety of graph structures. We evaluate the performance of GAP on graphs of varying sizes and structures, including graphs of widely used machine learning models (e.g., ResNet, VGG, and Inception-V3), scale-free graphs, and random graphs.},

Accurate predictions can enable both the drivers and the passengers to make better decisions about their travel route, departure time and travel origin selection, which can be helpful in traffic management. Multiple models and algorithms based on time series prediction and machine learning were applied to this issue and achieved acceptable results. Recently, the availability of sufficient data and computational power, motivates us to improve the prediction accuracy via deep-learning approaches. Recurrent neural networks have become one of the most popular methods for time series forecasting, however, due to the variety of these networks, the question that which type is the most appropriate one for this task remains unsolved. In this paper, we use three kinds of recurrent neural networks including simple RNN units, GRU and LSTM neural network to predict short-term traffic flow. The dataset from TAP30 Corporation is used for building the models and comparing RNNs with several well-known models, such as DEMA, LASSO and XGBoost. The results show that all three types of RNNs outperform the others, however, more simple RNNs such as simple recurrent units and GRU perform work better than LSTM in terms of accuracy and training time.},

From the perspective of human analysts and policy makers, forecasting algorithms must not only make accurate predictions but must also provide supporting evidence, e.g., the causal factors related to the event of interest. We develop a novel multiple instance learning based approach that jointly tackles the problem of identifying evidence-based precursors and forecasts events into the future. Specifically, given a collection of streaming news articles from multiple sources we develop a nested multiple instance learning approach to forecast significant societal events such as protests. Using data from three countries in Latin America, we demonstrate how our approach is able to consistently identify news articles considered as precursors for protests. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates the strengths of our proposed approach in filtering candidate precursors, in forecasting the occurrence of events with a lead time advantage and in accurately predicting the characteristics of civil unrest events.},

Combining forecasts from multiple temporal aggregation levels exploits information differences and mitigates model uncertainty, while reconciliation ensures a unified prediction that supports aligned decisions at different horizons. In previous studies, weights assigned to the forecasts were given by the structure of the hierarchy or the forecast error variances without considering potential autocorrelation in the forecast errors. Our first estimator considers the autocovariance matrix within each aggregation level. Since this can be difficult to estimate, we propose a second estimator that blends autocorrelation and variance information, but only requires estimation of the first-order autocorrelation coefficient at each aggregation level. Our third and fourth estimators facilitate information sharing between aggregation levels using robust estimates of the cross-correlation matrix and its inverse. We compare the proposed estimators in a simulation study and demonstrate their usefulness through an application to short-term electricity load forecasting in four price areas in Sweden. We find that by taking account of auto- and cross-covariances when reconciling forecasts, accuracy can be significantly improved uniformly across all frequencies and areas.},

  abstract = {Hierarchical forecasting problems arise when time series have a natural group structure, and predictions at multiple levels of aggregation and disaggregation across the groups are needed. In such problems, it is often desired to satisfy the aggregation constraints in a given hierarchy, referred to as hierarchical coherence in the literature. Maintaining hierarchical coherence while producing accurate forecasts can be a challenging problem, especially in the case of probabilistic forecasting. We present a novel method capable of accurate and coherent probabilistic forecasts for hierarchical time series. We call it Deep Poisson Mixture Network (DPMN). It relies on the combination of neural networks and a statistical model for the joint distribution of the hierarchical multivariate time series structure. By construction, the model guarantees hierarchical coherence and provides simple rules for aggregation and disaggregation of the predictive distributions. We perform an extensive empirical evaluation comparing the DPMN to other state-of-the-art methods which produce hierarchically coherent probabilistic forecasts on multiple public datasets. Compared to existing coherent probabilistic models, we obtained a relative improvement in the overall Continuous Ranked Probability Score (CRPS) of 17.1\% on Australian domestic tourism data, 24.2 on the Favorita grocery sales dataset, and 6.9\% on a San Francisco Bay Area highway traffic dataset.},

  abstract = {Retailers need demand forecasts at different levels of aggregation in order to support a variety of decisions along the supply chain. To ensure aligned decision-making across the hierarchy, it is essential that forecasts at the most disaggregated level add up to forecasts at the aggregate levels above. It is not clear if these aggregate forecasts should be generated independently or by using an hierarchical forecasting method that ensures coherent decision-making at the different levels but does not guarantee, at least, the same accuracy. To give guidelines on this issue, our empirical study investigates the relative performance of independent and reconciled forecasting approaches, using real data from a Portuguese retailer. We consider two alternative forecasting model families for generating the base forecasts; namely, state space models and ARIMA. Appropriate models from both families are chosen for each time-series by minimising the bias-corrected Akaike information criteria. The results show significant improvements in forecast accuracy, providing valuable information to support management decisions. It is clear that reconciled forecasts using the Minimum Trace Shrinkage estimator (MinT-Shrink) generally improve on the accuracy of the ARIMA base forecasts for all levels and for the complete hierarchy, across all forecast horizons. The accuracy gains generally increase with the horizon, varying between 1.7\% and 3.7\% for the complete hierarchy. It is also evident that the gains in forecast accuracy are more substantial at the higher levels of aggregation, which means that the information about the individual dynamics of the series, which was lost due to aggregation, is brought back again from the lower levels of aggregation to the higher levels by the reconciliation process, substantially improving the forecast accuracy over the base forecasts.},

  abstract = {Can meta-learning discover generic ways of processing time-series (TS) from a diverse dataset so as to greatly improve generalization on new TS coming from different datasets? This work provides positive evidence to demonstrate this using a broad meta-learning framework which we show subsumes many existing meta-learning algorithms as specific cases. We further identify via theoretical analysis the meta-learning adaptation mechanisms within N-BEATS, a recent neural TS forecasting model. Our meta-learning theory predicts that N-BEATS iteratively generates a subset of its task-specific parameters based on a given TS input, thus gradually expanding the expressive power of the architecture on-the-fly. Our empirical results emphasize the importance of meta-learning for successful zero-shot forecasting to new sources of TS, supporting the claim that it is viable to train a neural network on a source TS dataset and deploy it on a different target TS dataset without retraining, resulting in performance that is at least as good as that of state-of-practice univariate forecasting models.},

  abstract = {We focus on solving the univariate times series point forecasting problem using deep learning. We propose a deep neural architecture based on backward and forward residual links and a very deep stack of fully-connected layers. The architecture has a number of desirable properties, being interpretable, applicable without modification to a wide array of target domains, and fast to train. We test the proposed architecture on the well-known M4 competition dataset containing 100k time series from diverse domains. We demonstrate state-of-the-art performance for two configurations of N-BEATS, improving forecast accuracy by 11\% over a statistical benchmark and by 3\% over last year's winner of the M4 competition, a domain-adjusted hand-crafted hybrid between neural network and statistical time series models. The first configuration of our model does not employ any time-series-specific components and its performance on the M4 dataset strongly suggests that, contrarily to received wisdom, deep learning primitives such as residual blocks are by themselves sufficient to solve a wide range of forecasting problems. Finally, we demonstrate how the proposed architecture can be augmented to provide outputs that are interpretable without loss in accuracy.},

  abstract = {Producing high-quality forecasts of key climate variables such as temperature and precipitation on subseasonal time scales has long been a gap in operational forecasting. Recent studies have shown promising results using machine learning (ML) models to advance subseasonal forecasting (SSF), but several open questions remain. First, several past approaches use the average of an ensemble of physics-based forecasts as an input feature of these models. However, ensemble forecasts contain information that can aid prediction beyond only the ensemble mean. Second, past methods have focused on average performance, whereas forecasts of extreme events are far more important for planning and mitigation purposes. Third, climate forecasts correspond to a spatially-varying collection of forecasts, and different methods account for spatial variability in the response differently. Trade-offs between different approaches may be mitigated with model stacking. This paper describes the application of a variety of ML methods used to predict monthly average precipitation and two meter temperature using physics-based predictions (ensemble forecasts) and observational data such as relative humidity, pressure at sea level, or geopotential height, two weeks in advance for the whole continental United States. Regression, quantile regression, and tercile classification tasks using linear models, random forests, convolutional neural networks, and stacked models are considered. The proposed models outperform common baselines such as historical averages (or quantiles) and ensemble averages (or quantiles). This paper further includes an investigation of feature importance, trade-offs between using the full ensemble or only the ensemble average, and different modes of accounting for spatial variability.},

Forecasting over ST data is of great importance but challenging as it is affected by many complex factors, including spatial characteristics, temporal characteristics and the intrinsic causality between them. In this paper, we propose a general framework (HyperST-Net) based on hypernetworks for deep ST models. More specifically, it consists of three major modules: a spatial module, a temporal module and a deduction module. Among them, the deduction module derives the parameter weights of the temporal module from the spatial characteristics, which are extracted by the spatial module. Then, we design a general form of HyperST layer as well as different forms for several basic layers in neural networks, including the dense layer (HyperST-Dense) and the convolutional layer (HyperST-Conv). Experiments on three types of real-world tasks demonstrate that the predictive models integrated with our framework achieve significant improvements, and outperform the state-of-the-art baselines as well.},

In particular, a general framework is established that nests many existing popular reconciliation methods within the class of projections. This interpretation facilitates the derivation of novel theoretical results. First, reconciliation via projection is guaranteed to improve forecast accuracy with respect to a class of loss functions based on a generalised distance metric. Second, the Minimum Trace (MinT) method minimises expected loss for this same class of loss functions. Third, the geometric interpretation provides a new proof that forecast reconciliation using projections results in unbiased forecasts, provided that the initial base forecasts are also unbiased. Approaches for dealing with biased base forecasts are proposed. An extensive empirical study of Australian tourism flows demonstrates the theoretical results of the paper and shows that bias correction prior to reconciliation outperforms alternatives that only bias-correct or only reconcile forecasts.},

  abstract = {We develop a framework for prediction of multivariate data that follow some known linear constraints, such as the example where some variables are aggregates of others. This is particularly common when forecasting time series (predicting the future), but also arises in other types of prediction. For point prediction, an increasingly popular technique is reconciliation, whereby predictions are made for all series (so-called `base' predictions) and subsequently adjusted to ensure coherence with the constraints. This paper extends reconciliation from the setting of point prediction to probabilistic prediction. A novel definition of reconciliation is developed and used to construct densities and draw samples from a reconciled probabilistic prediction. In the elliptical case, it is proven that the true predictive distribution can be recovered from reconciliation even when the location and scale matrix of the base prediction are chosen arbitrarily. To find reconciliation weights, an objective function based on scoring rules is optimised. The energy and variogram scores are considered since the log score is improper in the context of comparing unreconciled to reconciled predictions, a result also proved in this paper. To account for the stochastic nature of the energy and variogram scores, optimisation is achieved using stochastic gradient descent. This method is shown to improve base predictions in simulation studies and in an empirical application, particularly when the base prediction models are severely misspecified. When misspecification is not too severe, extending popular reconciliation methods for point prediction can result in a similar performance to score optimisation via stochastic gradient descent. The methods described here are implemented in the ProbReco package for R.},

The main challenge is to exploit the hierarchical correlations to simultaneously obtain good prediction accuracy for time series at different levels of the hierarchy. In this paper, we propose a new approach for hierarchical forecasting which consists of two components. First, decomposing the time series along a global set of basis time series and modeling hierarchical constraints using the coefficients of the basis decomposition. And second, using a linear autoregressive model with coefficients that vary with time. Unlike past methods, our approach is scalable (inference for a specific time series only needs access to its own history) while also modeling the hierarchical structure via (approximate) coherence constraints among the time series forecasts. We experiment on several public datasets and demonstrate significantly improved overall performance on forecasts at different levels of the hierarchy, compared to existing state-of-the-art hierarchical models.},

This ability, referred to as lifelong learning, is mediated by a rich set of neurocognitive mechanisms that together contribute to the development and specialization of our sensorimotor skills as well as to long-term memory consolidation and retrieval. Consequently, lifelong learning capabilities are crucial for computational learning systems and autonomous agents interacting in the real world and processing continuous streams of information. However, lifelong learning remains a long-standing challenge for machine learning and neural network models since the continual acquisition of incrementally available information from non-stationary data distributions generally leads to catastrophic forgetting or interference. This limitation represents a major drawback for state-of-the-art deep neural network models that typically learn representations from stationary batches of training data, thus without accounting for situations in which information becomes incrementally available over time. In this review, we critically summarize the main challenges linked to lifelong learning for artificial learning systems and compare existing neural network approaches that alleviate, to different extents, catastrophic forgetting. Although significant advances have been made in domain-specific learning with neural networks, extensive research efforts are required for the development of robust lifelong learning on autonomous agents and robots. We discuss well-established and emerging research motivated by lifelong learning factors in biological systems such as structural plasticity, memory replay, curriculum and transfer learning, intrinsic motivation, and multisensory integration.},

This method, termed ``Actor-Mimic'', exploits the use of deep reinforcement learning and model compression techniques to train a single policy network that learns how to act in a set of distinct tasks by using the guidance of several expert teachers. We then show that the representations learnt by the deep policy network are capable of generalizing to new tasks with no prior expert guidance, speeding up learning in novel environments. Although our method can in general be applied to a wide range of problems, we use Atari games as a testing environment to demonstrate these methods.},

In this paper, we build a probabilistic model that involves dynamically evolving latent variables to capture the proportion changes in time series at each hierarchy. We derive the variational Bayesian expectation maximisation (VBEM) algorithm under the new model. In our algorithm, we implement the posterior inference in a sequential manner that significantly decreases computational overhead common in large hierarchical time series data. Furthermore, unlike the standard EM algorithm that provides point estimates of model parameters, our algorithm yields the distribution over the model parameters, which give us an insight to which subset of features yields the proportion changes of the time series. Simulation results show that our method significantly outperforms other methods in prediction.},

The high-dimensionality, velocity and variety of the data collected in these applications pose significant and unique challenges that must be carefully addressed for each of them.

The proposed method can be effectively combined with deep neural networks, leading to powerful deep learning models for time series analysis. However, combining existing BoF formulations with deep feature extractors pose significant challenges: the distribution of the input features is not stationary, tuning the hyper-parameters of the model can be especially difficult and the normalizations involved in the BoF model can cause significant instabilities during the training process. The proposed method is capable of overcoming these limitations by a employing a novel adaptive scaling mechanism and replacing the classical Gaussian-based density estimation involved in the regular BoF model with a logistic kernel. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated using extensive experiments on a large-scale financial time series dataset that consists of more than 4 million limit orders.},

It is therefore natural to ask: how much of the data is superfluous, which examples are important for generalization, and how do we find them? In this work, we make the striking observation that, on standard vision benchmarks, the initial loss gradient norm of individual training examples, averaged over several weight initializations, can be used to identify a smaller set of training data that is important for generalization. Furthermore, after only a few epochs of training, the information in gradient norms is reflected in the normed error--L2 distance between the predicted probabilities and one hot labels--which can be used to prune a significant fraction of the dataset without sacrificing test accuracy. Based on this, we propose data pruning methods which use only local information early in training, and connect them to recent work that prunes data by discarding examples that are rarely forgotten over the course of training. Our methods also shed light on how the underlying data distribution shapes the training dynamics: they rank examples based on their importance for generalization, detect noisy examples and identify subspaces of the model's data representation that are relatively stable over training.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a new approach to estimation and inference in panel data models with a general multifactor error structure. The unobserved factors and the individual-specific errors are allowed to follow arbitrary stationary processes, and the number of unobserved factors need not be estimated. The basic idea is to filter the individual-specific regressors by means of cross-section averages such that asymptotically as the cross-section dimension (N) tends to infinity, the differential effects of unobserved common factors are eliminated. The estimation procedure has the advantage that it can be computed by least squares applied to auxiliary regressions where the observed regressors are augmented with cross-sectional averages of the dependent variable and the individual-specific regressors. A number of estimators (referred to as common correlated effects (CCE) estimators) are proposed and their asymptotic distributions are derived. The small sample properties of mean group and pooled CCE estimators are investigated by Monte Carlo experiments, showing that the CCE estimators have satisfactory small sample properties even under a substantial degree of heterogeneity and dynamics, and for relatively small values of N and T.},

  abstract = {Clustering procedures suitable for the analysis of very high-dimensional data are needed for many modern data sets. One approach, called high-dimensional data clustering (HDDC), uses a family of Gaussian mixture models for clustering. HDDC is based on the idea that high-dimensional data usually exists in lower-dimensional subspaces; as such, an intrinsic dimension for each sub-population of the observed data can be estimated and cluster analysis can be performed in this lower-dimensional subspace. As a result, only a fraction of the total number of parameters needs to be estimated. This family of models has gained attention due to its superior classification performance compared to other families of mixture models; however, it still suffers from the usual limitations of Gaussian mixture model-based approaches, e.g., these models are sensitive to outlying or spurious points. In this paper, a robust analog of the HDDC approach is proposed. This approach, which extends the HDDC procedure to the multivariate-t distribution, encompasses 28 models that rectify the aforementioned shortcoming of the HDDC procedure. Our tHDDC procedure is compared to the HDDC procedure using both simulated and real data sets, which includes an image reconstruction problem that arose from satellite imagery of the surface of Mars.},

  abstract = {Causal inference uses observational data to infer the causal structure of the data generating system. We study a class of restricted Structural Equation Models for time series that we call Time Series Models with Independent Noise (TiMINo). These models require independent residual time series, whereas traditional methods like Granger causality exploit the variance of residuals. This work contains two main contributions: (l) Theoretical: By restricting the model class (e.g. to additive noise) we provide general identifiability results. They cover lagged and instantaneous effects that can be nonlinear and unfaithful, and non-instantaneous feedbacks between the time series. (2) Practical: If there are no feedback loops between time series, we propose an algorithm based on non-linear independence tests of time series. We show empirically that when the data are causally insufficient or the model is misspecified, the method avoids incorrect answers. We extend the theoretical and the algorithmic part to situations in which the time series have been measured with different time delays. TiMINo is applied to artificial and real data and code is provided.},

For that, we propose differentiable sorting networks by relaxing their pairwise conditional swap operations. To address the problems of vanishing gradients and extensive blurring that arise with larger numbers of layers, we propose mapping activations to regions with moderate gradients. We consider odd-even as well as bitonic sorting networks, which outperform existing relaxations of the sorting operation. We show that bitonic sorting networks can achieve stable training on large input sets of up to 1024 elements.},

We propose a new aggregation framework for intermittent demand forecasting that performs aggregation over the demand volumes, in contrast to the standard framework that employs temporal (over time) aggregation. To achieve this we construct a transformed time series, the inverse intermittent demand series. The new algorithm is expected to work best on erratic and lumpy demand, as a result of the variance reduction of the non-zero demands. The improvement in forecasting performance is empirically demonstrated through an extensive evaluation in more than 8000time series of two well-researched spare parts data sets from the automotive and defence sectors. Furthermore, a simulation is performed so as to provide a stock-control evaluation. The proposed framework could find popularity among practitioners given its suitability when dealing with clump sizes. As such it could be used in conjunction with existing popular forecasting methods for intermittent demand as an exception handling mechanism when certain types of demand are observed.},

This article provides a non-systematic review of the theory and the practice of forecasting. We provide an overview of a wide range of theoretical, state-of-the-art models, methods, principles, and approaches to prepare, produce, organise, and evaluate forecasts. We then demonstrate how such theoretical concepts are applied in a variety of real-life contexts. We do not claim that this review is an exhaustive list of methods and applications. However, we wish that our encyclopedic presentation will offer a point of reference for the rich work that has been undertaken over the last decades, with some key insights for the future of forecasting theory and practice. Given its encyclopedic nature, the intended mode of reading is non-linear. We offer cross-references to allow the readers to navigate through the various topics.

Here, a novel global decision tree learning method is proposed, where multi-output decision trees are constructed over the global interaction setting, addressing the problem of interaction prediction as a multi-label classification task. More specifically, the tree is constructed by splitting the interaction matrix both row-wise and column-wise, incorporating this way both interaction dataset features in the learning procedure. Experiments are conducted across several heterogeneous interaction datasets from the biomedical domain. The experimental results indicate the superiority of the proposed method against other decision tree approaches in terms of predictive accuracy, model size and computational efficiency. The performance is boosted by fully exploiting the multi-output structure of the model. We conclude that the proposed method should be considered in interaction prediction tasks, especially where interpretable models are desired.},

Meanwhile, in an important case of heterogenous tabular data, the advantage of DNNs over shallow counterparts remains questionable. In particular, there is no sufficient evidence that deep learning machinery allows constructing methods that outperform gradient boosting decision trees (GBDT), which are often the top choice for tabular problems. In this paper, we introduce Neural Oblivious Decision Ensembles (NODE), a new deep learning architecture, designed to work with any tabular data. In a nutshell, the proposed NODE architecture generalizes ensembles of oblivious decision trees, but benefits from both end-to-end gradient-based optimization and the power of multi-layer hierarchical representation learning. With an extensive experimental comparison to the leading GBDT packages on a large number of tabular datasets, we demonstrate the advantage of the proposed NODE architecture, which outperforms the competitors on most of the tasks. We open-source the PyTorch implementation of NODE and believe that it will become a universal framework for machine learning on tabular data.},

Previous model tree induction algorithms have been batch techniques that operate on the entire training set. However there are many situations when an incremental learner is advantageous. In this article a new batch model tree learner is described with two alternative splitting rules and a stopping rule. An incremental algorithm is then developed that has many similarities with the batch version but is able to process examples one at a time. An online pruning rule is also developed. The incremental training time for an example is shown to only depend on the height of the tree induced so far, and not on the number of previous examples. The algorithms are evaluated empirically on a number of standard datasets, a simple test function and three dynamic domains ranging from a simple pendulum to a complex 13 dimensional flight simulator. The new batch algorithm is compared with the most recent batch model tree algorithms and is seen to perform favourably overall. The new incremental model tree learner compares well with an alternative online function approximator. In addition it can sometimes perform almost as well as the batch model tree algorithms, highlighting the effectiveness of the incremental implementation.},

  abstract = {Ability of deep networks to extract high level features and of recurrent networks to perform time-series inference have been studied. In view of universality of one hidden layer network at approximating functions under weak constraints, the benefit of multiple layers is to enlarge the space of dynamical systems approximated or, given the space, reduce the number of units required for a certain error. Traditionally shallow networks with manually engineered features are used, back-propagation extent is limited to one and attempt to choose a large number of hidden units to satisfy the Markov condition is made. In case of Markov models, it has been shown that many systems need to be modeled as higher order. In the present work, we present deep recurrent networks with longer backpropagation through time extent as a solution to modeling systems that are high order and to predicting ahead. We study epileptic seizure suppression electro-stimulator. Extraction of manually engineered complex features and prediction employing them has not allowed small low-power implementations as, to avoid possibility of surgery, extraction of any features that may be required has to be included. In this solution, a recurrent neural network performs both feature extraction and prediction. We prove analytically that adding hidden layers or increasing backpropagation extent increases the rate of decrease of approximation error. A Dynamic Programming (DP) training procedure employing matrix operations is derived. DP and use of matrix operations makes the procedure efficient particularly when using data-parallel computing. The simulation studies show the geometry of the parameter space, that the network learns the temporal structure, that parameters converge while model output displays same dynamic behavior as the system and greater than .99 Average Detection Rate on all real seizure data tried.},

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) use machine learning to achieve state-of-the-art results with respect to many computer vision tasks. One of the main limiting aspects of CNNs is the computational cost of updating a large number of convolution parameters. Further, in the spatial domain, larger images take exponentially longer than smaller image to train on CNNs due to the operations involved in convolution methods. Consequently, CNNs are often not a viable solution for large image computer vision tasks. In this paper a Fourier Convolution Neural Network (FCNN) is proposed whereby training is conducted entirely within the Fourier domain. The advantage offered is that there is a significant speed up in training time without loss of effectiveness. Using the proposed approach larger images can therefore be processed within viable computation time. The FCNN is fully described and evaluated. The evaluation was conducted using the benchmark Cifar10 and MNIST datasets, and a bespoke fundus retina image dataset. The results demonstrate that convolution in the Fourier domain gives a significant speed up without adversely affecting accuracy. For simplicity the proposed FCNN concept is presented in the context of a basic CNN architecture, however, the FCNN concept has the potential to improve the speed of any neural network system involving convolution.},

We captured and modified the idea of PCM algorithm by eliminating unnecessary processes which can be handled directly by Batcher's odd-even mergesort architecture. VLSI design of this parallel sorter is low complexity. It has 2k+1 clock cycles latency, which k represents the number of iterative steps for each kind of sorter block (odd or even).

  abstract = {Deep learning has achieved impressive prediction performance in the field of sequence learning recently. Dissolved oxygen prediction, as a kind of time-series forecasting, is suitable for this technique. Although many researchers have developed hybrid models or variant models based on deep learning techniques, there is no comprehensive and sound comparison among the deep learning models in this field currently. Plus, most previous studies focused on one-step forecasting by using a small data set. As the convenient access to high-frequency data, this paper compares multi-step deep learning forecasting by using walk-forward validation. Specifically, we test Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), Bidirectional Recurrent Neural Network (BiRNN) based on the realtime data recorded automatically at a fixed observation point in the Yangtze River from 2012 to 2016. By comparing the average accumulated statistical metrics of root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and coefficient of determination in each time step, We find for multi-step time series forecasting, the average performance of each time step does not decrease linearly. GRU outperforms other models with significant advantages.},

  abstract = {The Nonlinear autoregressive exogenous (NARX) model, which predicts the current value of a time series based upon its previous values as well as the current and past values of multiple driving (exogenous) series, has been studied for decades. Despite the fact that various NARX models have been developed, few of them can capture the long-term temporal dependencies appropriately and select the relevant driving series to make predictions. In this paper, we propose a dual-stage attention-based recurrent neural network (DA-RNN) to address these two issues. In the first stage, we introduce an input attention mechanism to adaptively extract relevant driving series (a.k.a., input features) at each time step by referring to the previous encoder hidden state. In the second stage, we use a temporal attention mechanism to select relevant encoder hidden states across all time steps. With this dual-stage attention scheme, our model can not only make predictions effectively, but can also be easily interpreted. Thorough empirical studies based upon the SML 2010 dataset and the NASDAQ 100 Stock dataset demonstrate that the DA-RNN can outperform state-of-the-art methods for time series prediction.},

We focus on several datasets and various perturbations to both covariates and label distributions with varying magnitudes and fractions of data affected. Interestingly, we show that across the dataset shifts that we explore, a two-sample-testing-based approach, using pre-trained classifiers for dimensionality reduction, performs best. Moreover, we demonstrate that domain-discriminating approaches tend to be helpful for characterizing shifts qualitatively and determining if they are harmful.},

It appears in diverse practical scenarios ranging from DevOps to IoT, where we want to recognize failures of a system that operates under the influence of a surrounding environment. Intrinsic anomalies are changes in the functional dependency structure between time series that represent an environment and time series that represent the internal state of a system that is placed in said environment. We formalize this problem, provide under-studied public and new purpose-built data sets for it, and present methods that handle intrinsic anomaly detection. These address the short-coming of existing anomaly detection methods that cannot differentiate between expected changes in the system's state and unexpected ones, i.e., changes in the system that deviate from the environment's influence. Our most promising approach is fully unsupervised and combines adversarial learning and time series representation learning, thereby addressing problems such as label sparsity and subjectivity, while allowing to navigate and improve notoriously problematic anomaly detection data sets.},

This is in contrast with the frequently stated belief that self-attention requires \$O(n\^2)\$ memory. While the time complexity is still \$O(n\^2)\$, device memory rather than compute capability is often the limiting factor on modern accelerators. Thus, reducing the memory requirements of attention allows processing of longer sequences than might otherwise be feasible. We provide a practical implementation for accelerators that requires \$O(\textbackslash sqrt\{n\})\$ memory, is numerically stable, and is within a few percent of the runtime of the standard implementation of attention. We also demonstrate how to differentiate the function while remaining memory-efficient. For sequence length 16384, the memory overhead of self-attention is reduced by 59X for inference and by 32X for differentiation.},

Simply put, the aim is to quantify the 'before versus after' effect of climate related human driven interventions, such as urbanization; as well as natural disasters, such as hurricanes and forest fires. As a concrete example, we focus on quantifying forest tree cover change/ deforestation due to human led causes. The proposed method involves the following steps. First, we uae computer vision and machine learning/deep learning techniques to detect and quantify forest tree coverage levels over time, at every time epoch. We then look at this time series to identify changepoints. Next, we estimate the expected (forest tree cover) values using a Bayesian structural causal model and projecting/forecasting the counterfactual. This is compared to the values actually observed post intervention, and the difference in the two values gives us the effect of the intervention (as compared to the non intervention scenario, i.e. what would have possibly happened without the intervention). As a specific use case, we analyze deforestation levels before and after the hyperinflation event (intervention) in Brazil (which ended in 1993-94), for the Amazon rainforest region, around Rondonia, Brazil. For this deforestation use case, using our causal inference framework can help causally attribute change/reduction in forest tree cover and increasing deforestation rates due to human activities at various points in time.},

Currently, the most successful and widely-used activation function is the Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU).

In this work, we propose to leverage automatic search techniques to discover new activation functions. Using a combination of exhaustive and reinforcement learning-based search, we discover multiple novel activation functions. We verify the effectiveness of the searches by conducting an empirical evaluation with the best discovered activation function. Our experiments show that the best discovered activation function, f (x) = x {$\cdot$} sigmoid({$\beta$}x), which we name Swish, tends to work better than ReLU on deeper models across a number of challenging datasets. For example, simply replacing ReLUs with Swish units improves top-1 classification accuracy on ImageNet by 0.9\% for Mobile NASNet-A and 0.6\% for Inception-ResNet-v2. The simplicity of Swish and its similarity to ReLU make it easy for practitioners to replace ReLUs with Swish units in any neural network.},

These forecasting problems are usually treated independently by learning different ML models which results in forecasts that are not consistent with the temporal aggregation structure, leading to inefficient decision making. Some of the recent work addressed this problem, however, it uses a post-hoc reconciliation strategy, which results in sub-optimal results and cannot produce probabilistic forecasts. In this paper, we present a global model that produces coherent, probabilistic forecasts for different time granularities by learning joint embeddings for the different aggregation levels with graph neural networks and temporal reconciliation. Temporal reconciliation not only enables consistent decisions for business problems across different planning horizons but also improves the quality of forecasts at finer time granularities. A thorough empirical evaluation illustrates the benefits of the proposed method.},

This is achieved by applying the reparameterization trick and casting reconciliation as an optimization problem with a closed-form solution. These model features make end-to-end learning of hierarchical forecasts possible, while accomplishing the challenging task of generating forecasts that are both probabilistic and coherent.

  abstract = {In this work, we propose TimeGrad, an autoregressive model for multivariate probabilistic time series forecasting which samples from the data distribution at each time step by estimating its gradient. To this end, we use diffusion probabilistic models, a class of latent variable models closely connected to score matching and energy-based methods. Our model learns gradients by optimizing a variational bound on the data likelihood and at inference time converts white noise into a sample of the distribution of interest through a Markov chain using Langevin sampling. We demonstrate experimentally that the proposed autoregressive denoising diffusion model is the new state-of-the-art multivariate probabilistic forecasting method on real-world data sets with thousands of correlated dimensions. We hope that this method is a useful tool for practitioners and lays the foundation for future research in this area.},

  abstract = {Time series forecasting is often fundamental to scientific and engineering problems and enables decision making. With ever increasing data set sizes, a trivial solution to scale up predictions is to assume independence between interacting time series. However, modeling statistical dependencies can improve accuracy and enable analysis of interaction effects. Deep learning methods are well suited for this problem, but multi-variate models often assume a simple parametric distribution and do not scale to high dimensions. In this work we model the multi-variate temporal dynamics of time series via an autoregressive deep learning model, where the data distribution is represented by a conditioned normalizing flow. This combination retains the power of autoregressive models, such as good performance in extrapolation into the future, with the flexibility of flows as a general purpose high-dimensional distribution model, while remaining computationally tractable. We show that it improves over the state-of-the-art for standard metrics on many real-world data sets with several thousand interacting time-series.},

In this paper we consider models constructed with the help of dynamical systems that have relatively simple limiting behavior. Switching between different trajectories of the phase portrait, we obtain a high precision prediction. Moreover, the dynamical system approach provides the global qualitative picture of the model's phase portrait, and allows us to discuss multidimensional patterns and long-term properties of the process. The simple limiting behavior allows us to associate different trends with different process's realization scenarios that can be influenced by externalities. We demonstrate these ideas using the examples of the Wikipedia's traffic of Readers, Contributors and Edits. First, we consider the two-dimensional model, predicting the traffic of Readers and Edits. The prediction precision is higher than the two-dimensional VAR prediction. Different trends (corresponding to different fixed points) can be associated with different platform's incentives. Then, adding the Contributors data, we discuss the three-dimensional model (more precise than the three-dimensional VAR). It provides a more accurate short-term prediction of Edits than the two-dimensional dynamic model. The global picture shows that the number of new Edits tends to decline in the future, while the number of new Contributors and Readers will grow in the long run.},

This has been driven by rapid advances in the applications and accuracy of AI through increasingly complex algorithms and models; this, in turn, has spurred research into specialized hardware AI accelerators. Given the rapid pace of advances, it is easy to forget that they are often developed and evaluated in a vacuum without considering the full application environment. This paper emphasizes the need for a holistic, end-to-end analysis of AI workloads and reveals the ``AI tax.'' We deploy and characterize Face Recognition in an edge data center. The application is an AI-centric edge video analytics application built using popular open source infrastructure and ML tools. Despite using state-of-the-art AI and ML algorithms, the application relies heavily on preand post-processing code. As AI-centric applications benefit from the acceleration promised by accelerators, we find they impose stresses on the hardware and software infrastructure: storage and network bandwidth become major bottlenecks with increasing AI acceleration. By specializing for AI applications, we show that a purpose-built edge data center can be designed for the stresses of accelerated AI at 15\% lower TCO than one derived from homogeneous servers and infrastructure.

The model assumes independent observations of the response variable y given the parameters, the explanatory variables and the values of the random effects. The distribution for the response variable in the GAMLSS can be selected from a very general family of distributions including highly skew or kurtotic continuous and discrete distributions. The systematic part of the model is expanded to allow modelling not only of the mean (or location) but also of the other parameters of the distribution of y, as parametric and/or additive nonparametric (smooth) functions of explanatory variables and/or random-effects terms. Maximum (penalized) likelihood estimation is used to fit the (non)parametric models. A Newton\textendash Raphson or Fisher scoring algorithm is used to maximize the (penalized) likelihood. The additive terms in the model are fitted by using a backfitting algorithm. Censored data are easily incorporated into the framework. Five data sets from different fields of application are analysed to emphasize the generality of the GAMLSS class of models.},

We demonstrate through computer experiments both the qualitative and the quantitative charac- teristics of the Gini regularized OT problem. Moreover, we show that the Gini regularized OT problem converges to the classical OT problem, when the Gini regularized problem is considered as a function of \{\textbackslash lambda\}, the regularization parame-ter. The convergence to the classical OT solution is faster than the state-of-the-art Entropic-regularized OT[Cuturi, 2013] and results in a numerically more stable algorithm.},

In this paper we propose a new method that is fully adaptive to heteroscedasticity. It combines conformal prediction with classical quantile regression, inheriting the advantages of both. We establish a theoretical guarantee of valid coverage, supplemented by extensive experiments on popular regression datasets. We compare the efficiency of conformalized quantile regression to other conformal methods, showing that our method tends to produce shorter intervals.},

Some recent approaches (Daum\'e III et al., 2009; Ross and Bagnell, 2010) provide stronger guarantees in this setting, but remain somewhat unsatisfactory as they train either non-stationary or stochastic policies and require a large number of iterations. In this paper, we propose a new iterative algorithm, which trains a stationary deterministic policy, that can be seen as a no regret algorithm in an online learning setting. We show that any such no regret algorithm, combined with additional reduction assumptions, must find a policy with good performance under the distribution of observations it induces in such sequential settings. We demonstrate that this new approach outperforms previous approaches on two challenging imitation learning problems and a benchmark sequence labeling problem.},

To prevent overfitting, we i) randomly select the image data fed to the input layer, ii) automatically adapt the rMLP topology to meet the complexity of the data arriving at the node and iii) introduce an 1-norm based regularization that additionally sparsifies the network.

  abstract = {Currently, most real-world time series datasets are multivariate and are rich in dynamical information of the underlying system. Such datasets are attracting much attention; therefore, the need for accurate modelling of such high-dimensional datasets is increasing. Recently, the deep architecture of the recurrent neural network (RNN) and its variant long short-term memory (LSTM) have been proven to be more accurate than traditional statistical methods in modelling time series data. Despite the reported advantages of the deep LSTM model, its performance in modelling multivariate time series (MTS) data has not been satisfactory, particularly when attempting to process highly non-linear and long-interval MTS datasets. The reason is that the supervised learning approach initializes the neurons randomly in such recurrent networks, disabling the neurons that ultimately must properly learn the latent features of the correlated variables included in the MTS dataset. In this paper, we propose a pre-trained LSTM-based stacked autoencoder (LSTM-SAE) approach in an unsupervised learning fashion to replace the random weight initialization strategy adopted in deep LSTM recurrent networks. For evaluation purposes, two different case studies that include real-world datasets are investigated, where the performance of the proposed approach compares favourably with the deep LSTM approach. In addition, the proposed approach outperforms several reference models investigating the same case studies. Overall, the experimental results clearly show that the unsupervised pre-training approach improves the performance of deep LSTM and leads to better and faster convergence than other models.},

In retail businesses, for example, probabilistic demand forecasts are crucial for having the right inventory available at the right time and in the right place. This paper proposes DeepAR, a methodology for producing accurate probabilistic forecasts, based on training an autoregressive recurrent neural network model on a large number of related time series. We demonstrate how the application of deep learning techniques to forecasting can overcome many of the challenges that are faced by widely-used classical approaches to the problem. By means of extensive empirical evaluations on several real-world forecasting datasets, we show that our methodology produces more accurate forecasts than other state-of-the-art methods, while requiring minimal manual work.},

  abstract = {Predicting the dependencies between observations from multiple time series is critical for applications such as anomaly detection, financial risk management, causal analysis, or demand forecasting. However, the computational and numerical difficulties of estimating time-varying and high-dimensional covariance matrices often limits existing methods to handling at most a few hundred dimensions or requires making strong assumptions on the dependence between series. We propose to combine an RNN-based time series model with a Gaussian copula process output model with a low-rank covariance structure to reduce the computational complexity and handle non-Gaussian marginal distributions. This permits to drastically reduce the number of parameters and consequently allows the modeling of time-varying correlations of thousands of time series. We show on several real-world datasets that our method provides significant accuracy improvements over state-of-the-art baselines and perform an ablation study analyzing the contributions of the different components of our model.},

Gaussian processes are the de facto surrogate model due to their ability to capture uncertainty but they make strong assumptions about the observation noise, which might not be warranted in practice. In this work, we propose to leverage conformalized quantile regression which makes minimal assumptions about the observation noise and, as a result, models the target function in a more realistic and robust fashion which translates to quicker HPO convergence on empirical benchmarks. To apply our method in a multi-fidelity setting, we propose a simple, yet effective, technique that aggregates observed results across different resource levels and outperforms conventional methods across many empirical tasks.},

Traditional gradient-based networks require a lot of data to learn, often through extensive iterative training. When new data is encountered, the models must inefficiently relearn their parameters to adequately incorporate the new information without catastrophic interference. Architectures with augmented memory capacities, such as Neural Turing Machines (NTMs), offer the ability to quickly encode and retrieve new information, and hence can potentially obviate the downsides of conventional models. Here, we demonstrate the ability of a memory-augmented neural network to rapidly assimilate new data, and leverage this data to make accurate predictions after only a few samples. We also introduce a new method for accessing an external memory that focuses on memory content, unlike previous methods that additionally use memory locationbased focusing mechanisms.},

Furthermore, their usefulness over the product life-cycle has not been investigated, even though this may change, as consumers may search initially for pre-purchase information, but later for after-sales support. This study begins by reviewing the relevant literature, then attempts to support the key findings using two forecasting case studies. Our findings are in stark contrast to those in the previous literature, as we find that established univariate forecasting benchmarks, such as exponential smoothing, consistently perform better those that include online information. Our research underlines the need for a thorough forecast evaluation and argues that the usefulness of online platform data for supporting operational decisions may be limited.},

Essential descriptive statistics such as the variance, standard deviation, covariance, and correlation can suffer from a numerical instability known as "catastrophic cancellation" that can lead to problems when naively computing these statistics with a popular textbook equation. While this instability has been discussed in the literature already 50 years ago, we found that even today, some high-profile tools still employ the instable version. In this paper, we study a popular incremental technique originally proposed by Welford, which we extend to weighted covariance and correlation. We also discuss strategies for further improving numerical precision, how to compute such statistics online on a data stream, with exponential aging, with missing data, and a batch parallelization for both high performance and numerical precision. We demonstrate when the numerical instability arises, and the performance of different approaches under these conditions. We showcase applications from the classic computation of variance as well as advanced applications such as stock market analysis with exponentially weighted moving models and Gaussian mixture modeling for cluster analysis that all benefit from this approach.},

Machine Learning (ML) researchers came up with various models and a vast number of studies have been published accordingly. As such, a significant amount of surveys exist covering ML for financial time series forecasting studies. Lately, Deep Learning (DL) models started appearing within the field, with results that significantly outperform traditional ML counterparts. Even though there is a growing interest in developing models for financial time series forecasting research, there is a lack of review papers that were solely focused on DL for finance. Hence, our motivation in this paper is to provide a comprehensive literature review on DL studies for financial time series forecasting implementations. We not only categorized the studies according to their intended forecasting implementation areas, such as index, forex, commodity forecasting, but also grouped them based on their DL model choices, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Deep Belief Networks (DBNs), Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM). We also tried to envision the future for the field by highlighting the possible setbacks and opportunities, so the interested researchers can benefit.},

  abstract = {A common operation in many data analytics workloads is to find the top-k items, i.e., the largest or smallest operations according to some sort order (implemented via LIMIT or ORDER BY expressions in SQL). A naive implementation of top-k is to sort all of the items and then return the first k, but this does much more work than needed. Although efficient implementations for top-k have been explored on traditional multi-core processors, there has been no prior systematic study of top-k implementations on GPUs, despite open requests for such implementations in GPU-based frameworks like TensorFlow and ArrayFire. In this work, we present several top-k algorithms for GPUs, including a new algorithm based on bitonic sort called bitonic top-k. The bitonic top-k algorithm is up to a factor of \textbackslash new15x faster than sort and 4x faster than a variety of other possible implementations for values of k up to 256. We also develop a cost model to predict the performance of several of our algorithms, and show that it accurately predicts actual performance on modern GPUs.},

  abstract = {Modeling large scale and rare-interaction users are the two major challenges in recommender systems, which derives big gaps between researches and applications. Facing to millions or even billions of users, it is hard to store and leverage personalized preferences with a user embedding matrix in real scenarios. And many researches pay attention to users with rich histories, while users with only one or several interactions are the biggest part in real systems. Previous studies make efforts to handle one of the above issues but rarely tackle efficiency and cold-start problems together. In this work, a novel user preference representation called Preference Hash (PreHash) is proposed to model large scale users, including rare-interaction ones. In PreHash, a series of buckets are generated based on users' historical interactions. Users with similar preferences are assigned into the same buckets automatically, including warm and cold ones. Representations of the buckets are learned accordingly. Contributing to the designed hash buckets, only limited parameters are stored, which saves a lot of memory for more efficient modeling. Furthermore, when new interactions are made by a user, his buckets and representations will be dynamically updated, which enables more effective understanding and modeling of the user. It is worth mentioning that PreHash is flexible to work with various recommendation algorithms by taking the place of previous user embedding matrices. We combine it with multiple state-of-the-art recommendation methods and conduct various experiments. Comparative results on public datasets show that it not only improves the recommendation performance but also significantly reduces the number of model parameters. To summarize, PreHash has achieved significant improvements in both efficiency and effectiveness for recommender systems.},

It is commonly infeasible to sample a large number of trials, as required by current reinforcement learning methods, in a physical environment. This paper reports our project on using reinforcement learning for better commodity search in Taobao, one of the largest online retail platforms and meanwhile a physical environment with a high sampling cost. Instead of training reinforcement learning in Taobao directly, we present our approach: first we build Virtual Taobao, a simulator learned from historical customer behavior data through the proposed GAN-SD (GAN for Simulating Distributions) and MAIL (multi-agent adversarial imitation learning), and then we train policies in Virtual Taobao with no physical costs in which ANC (Action Norm Constraint) strategy is proposed to reduce over-fitting. In experiments, Virtual Taobao is trained from hundreds of millions of customers' records, and its properties are compared with the real environment. The results disclose that Virtual Taobao faithfully recovers important properties of the real environment. We also show that the policies trained in Virtual Taobao can have significantly superior online performance to the traditional supervised approaches. We hope our work could shed some light on reinforcement learning applications in complex physical environments.},

  abstract = {Forecasting of multivariate time series data, for instance the prediction of electricity consumption, solar power production, and polyphonic piano pieces, has numerous valuable applications. However, complex and non-linear interdependencies between time steps and series complicate this task. To obtain accurate prediction, it is crucial to model long-term dependency in time series data, which can be achieved by recurrent neural networks (RNNs) with an attention mechanism. The typical attention mechanism reviews the information at each previous time step and selects relevant information to help generate the outputs; however, it fails to capture temporal patterns across multiple time steps. In this paper, we propose using a set of filters to extract time-invariant temporal patterns, similar to transforming time series data into its ``frequency domain''. Then we propose a novel attention mechanism to select relevant time series, and use its frequency domain information for multivariate forecasting. We apply the proposed model on several real-world tasks and achieve state-of-the-art performance in all of these with a single exception.

Forecasts for such hierarchical time series should be coherent, meaning that the forecast for an upper-level time series equals the sum of forecasts for corresponding lower-level time series. Previous methods for making coherent forecasts consist of two phases: first computing base (incoherent) forecasts and then reconciling those forecasts based on their inherent hierarchical structure. With the aim of improving time series predictions, we propose a structured regularization method for completing both phases simultaneously. The proposed method is based on a prediction model for bottom-level time series and uses a structured regularization term to incorporate upper-level forecasts into the prediction model. We also develop a backpropagation algorithm specialized for application of our method to artificial neural networks for time series prediction. Experimental results using synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method in terms of prediction accuracy and computational efficiency.},

Most of the previous work has attempted to predict the future based on the current value of a stream. However, for many problems the actual values are irrelevant, whereas the shape of the current time series pattern may foretell the future. The handful of research efforts that consider this variant of the problem have met with limited success. In particular, it is now understood that most of these efforts allow the discovery of spurious rules. We believe the reason why rule discovery in real-valued time series has failed thus far is because most efforts have more or less indiscriminately applied the ideas of symbolic stream rule discovery to real-valued rule discovery. In this work, we show why these ideas are not directly suitable for rule discovery in time series. Beyond our novel definitions/representations, which allow for meaningful and extendable specifications of rules, we further show novel algorithms that allow us to quickly discover high quality rules in very large datasets that accurately predict the occurrence of future events.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a novel framework for demystification of convolutional deep learning models for time-series analysis. This is a step towards making informed/explainable decisions in the domain of time-series, powered by deep learning. There have been numerous efforts to increase the interpretability of image-centric deep neural network models, where the learned features are more intuitive to visualize. Visualization in time-series domain is much more complicated as there is no direct interpretation of the filters and inputs as compared to the image modality. In addition, little or no concentration has been devoted for the development of such tools in the domain of time-series in the past. TSViz provides possibilities to explore and analyze a network from different dimensions at different levels of abstraction which includes identification of parts of the input that were responsible for a prediction (including per filter saliency), importance of different filters present in the network for a particular prediction, notion of diversity present in the network through filter clustering, understanding of the main sources of variation learnt by the network through inverse optimization, and analysis of the network's robustness against adversarial noise. As a sanity check for the computed influence values, we demonstrate results regarding pruning of neural networks based on the computed influence information. These representations allow to understand the network features so that the acceptability of deep networks for time-series data can be enhanced. This is extremely important in domains like finance, industry 4.0, self-driving cars, health-care, counter-terrorism etc., where reasons for reaching a particular prediction are equally important as the prediction itself. We assess the proposed framework for interpretability with a set of desirable properties essential for any method in this direction.},

We compare these boosting algorithms with trees as base learners using various datasets and loss functions. Our experiments show that Newton boosting outperforms gradient and hybrid gradient-Newton boosting in terms of predictive accuracy on the majority of datasets. We also present evidence that the reason for this is not faster convergence of Newton boosting.

Tensors are the mathematical equivalents of these multi-channel causal channels. A multi-channel causal channel is a generalization of a discrete memoryless channel. Investigation of a system comprising three variables shows that in our formalism, bivariate analysis suffices to differentiate between direct and indirect relations. For this to be true, we have to combine the output of multi-channel causal channels with the output of single-channel causal channels. We can understand this result when we consider the role of noise. Subsequent transmission of information over noisy channels can never result in less noisy transmission overall. This implies that a Data Processing Inequality exists for transfer entropy.},

This competition compares ANNS algorithms at billion-scale by hardware cost, accuracy and performance.

Our main contribution is a thorough evaluation of networks of increasing depth using an architecture with very small (3 \texttimes{} 3) convolution filters, which shows that a significant improvement on the prior-art configurations can be achieved by pushing the depth to 16\textendash 19 weight layers. These findings were the basis of our ImageNet Challenge 2014 submission, where our team secured the first and the second places in the localisation and classification tracks respectively. We also show that our representations generalise well to other datasets, where they achieve state-of-the-art results. We have made our two best-performing ConvNet models publicly available to facilitate further research on the use of deep visual representations in computer vision.},

As most macroeoconomic time series are very persistent and may contain unit roots, a proper handling of unit roots and cointegration is of paramount importance for macroeconomic forecasting. The high-dimensional nature of Big Data complicates the analysis of unit roots and cointegration in two ways. First, transformations to stationarity require performing many unit root tests, increasing room for errors in the classification. Second, modelling unit roots and cointegration directly is more difficult, as standard high-dimensional techniques such as factor models and penalized regression are not directly applicable to (co)integrated data and need to be adapted. We provide an overview of both issues and review methods proposed to address these issues. These methods are also illustrated with two empirical applications.},

We examine various different approaches to demand forecasting for such products, paying particular attention to the need for inventory planning over a multi-period lead-time when the underlying process may be non-stationary. This emphasis leads to the consideration of prediction distributions for processes with time-dependent parameters. A wide range of possible distributions could be considered, but we focus upon the Poisson (as a widely used benchmark), the negative binomial (as a popular extension of the Poisson), and a hurdle shifted Poisson (which retains Croston's notion of a Bernoulli process for the occurrence of active demand periods). We also develop performance measures which are related to the entire prediction distribution, rather than focusing exclusively upon point predictions. The three models are compared using data on the monthly demand for 1046 automobile parts, provided by a US automobile manufacturer. We conclude that inventory planning should be based upon dynamic models using distributions that are more flexible than the traditional Poisson scheme.},

To directly search on the computationally expensive WMT 2014 English-German translation task, we develop the Progressive Dynamic Hurdles method, which allows us to dynamically allocate more resources to more promising candidate models. The architecture found in our experiments -- the Evolved Transformer -- demonstrates consistent improvement over the Transformer on four well-established language tasks: WMT 2014 English-German, WMT 2014 English-French, WMT 2014 English-Czech and LM1B. At a big model size, the Evolved Transformer establishes a new state-of-the-art BLEU score of 29.8 on WMT'14 English-German; at smaller sizes, it achieves the same quality as the original "big" Transformer with 37.6\% less parameters and outperforms the Transformer by 0.7 BLEU at a mobile-friendly model size of 7M parameters.},

That is, we use quantile regression to estimate the true conditional quantile and then apply a conformal step on a calibration set to ensure marginal coverage. In this way, we get adaptive prediction intervals that account for heteroscedasticity. However, the aforementioned conformal step lacks adaptiveness as described in (Romano et al., 2019). To overcome this limitation, instead of applying a single conformal step after estimating conditional quantiles with quantile regression, we propose to cluster the explanatory variables weighted by their permutation importance with an optimized k-means and apply k conformal steps. To show that this improved version outperforms the classic version of conformalized quantile regression and is more adaptive to heteroscedasticity, we extensively compare the prediction intervals of both in open datasets.},

  abstract = {Ordinary least squares regression focuses on the expected response and strongly depends on the assumption of normally distributed errors for inferences. An approach to overcome these restrictions is expectile regression, where no distributional assumption is made but rather the whole distribution of the response is described in terms of covariates. This is similar to quantile regression, but expectiles provide a convenient generalization of the arithmetic mean while quantiles are a generalization of the median. To analyze more complex data structures where purely linear predictors are no longer sufficient, semiparametric regression methods have been introduced for both ordinary least squares and expectile regression. However, with increasing complexity of the data and the regression structure, the selection of the true covariates and their effects becomes even more important than in standard regression models. Therefore we introduce several approaches depending on selection criteria and shrinkage methods to perform model selection in semiparametric expectile regression. Moreover, we propose a joint approach for model selection based on several asymmetries simultaneously to deal with the special feature that expectile regression estimates the complete distribution of the response. Furthermore, to distinguish between linear and smooth predictors, we split nonlinear effects into the purely linear trend and the deviation from this trend. All selection methods are compared with the benchmark of functional gradient descent boosting in a simulation study and applied to determine the relevant covariates when studying childhood malnutrition in Peru.},

Since then, although it has been shown that Theta provides accurate forecasts for various types of data, being a solid benchmark to beat, limited research has been conducted to exploit its full potential and generalize its reach. This paper examines three extensions on Theta's framework to boost its performance. This includes (i) considering both linear and non-linear trends, (ii) allowing to adjust the slope of such trends, and (iii) introducing a multiplicative expression of the underlying forecasting model along with the existing, additive one. The proposed modifications transform Theta into a generalized forecasting algorithm, suitable for automatic time series predictions. The proposed algorithm is evaluated using the series of the M, M3, and M4 competitions. Such an evaluation shows that the proposed approach produces more accurate forecasts than the original, classic Theta, both in terms of point forecasts and prediction intervals, and is also more accurate than other well-known methods for yearly series.},

Such combinations offer coherent reconciled forecasts, improved forecasting performance and aligned decision-making. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical forecasting approach based on machine learning. The proposed method allows for non-linear combinations of the base forecasts, thus being more general than linear approaches. We structurally combine the objectives of improved post-sample empirical forecasting accuracy and coherence. Due to its non-linear nature, our approach selectively combines the base forecasts in a direct and automated way without requiring that the complete information must be used for producing reconciled forecasts for each series and level. The proposed method is evaluated both in terms of accuracy and bias using two different data sets coming from the tourism and retail industries. Our results suggest that the proposed method gives superior point forecasts than existing approaches, especially when the series comprising the hierarchy are not characterized by the same patterns.},

  abstract = {Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM) are hugely popular for solving tabular data problems. However, practitioners are not only interested in point predictions, but also in probabilistic predictions in order to quantify the uncertainty of the predictions. Creating such probabilistic predictions is difficult with existing GBM-based solutions: they either require training multiple models or they become too computationally expensive to be useful for large-scale settings. We propose Probabilistic Gradient Boosting Machines (PGBM), a method to create probabilistic predictions with a single ensemble of decision trees in a computationally efficient manner. PGBM approximates the leaf weights in a decision tree as a random variable, and approximates the mean and variance of each sample in a dataset via stochastic tree ensemble update equations. These learned moments allow us to subsequently sample from a specified distribution after training. We empirically demonstrate the advantages of PGBM compared to existing state-of-the-art methods: (i) PGBM enables probabilistic estimates without compromising on point performance in a single model, (ii) PGBM learns probabilistic estimates via a single model only (and without requiring multi-parameter boosting), and thereby offers a speedup of up to several orders of magnitude over existing state-of-the-art methods on large datasets, and (iii) PGBM achieves accurate probabilistic estimates in tasks with complex differentiable loss functions, such as hierarchical time series problems, where we observed up to 10\% improvement in point forecasting performance and up to 300\% improvement in probabilistic forecasting performance.},

Large networks are also slow to use, making it difficult to deal with overfitting by combining the predictions of many different large neural nets at test time. Dropout is a technique for addressing this problem. The key idea is to randomly drop units (along with their connections) from the neural network during training. This prevents units from co-adapting too much. During training, dropout samples from an exponential number of different ``thinned'' networks. At test time, it is easy to approximate the effect of averaging the predictions of all these thinned networks by simply using a single unthinned network that has smaller weights. This significantly reduces overfitting and gives major improvements over other regularization methods. We show that dropout improves the performance of neural networks on supervised learning tasks in vision, speech recognition, document classification and computational biology, obtaining state-of-the-art results on many benchmark data sets.},

In particular, we show that changes in model parameters over time can help us quantify how well a state or a country has responded to the epidemic.

Formulated as unsupervised anomaly detection tasks, an abundance of applications like aviation safety management, the health monitoring of complex infrastructures or fraud detection can now rely on such functional data, acquired and stored with an ever finer granularity. The concept of statistical depth, which reflects centrality of an arbitrary observation w.r.t. a statistical population may play a crucial role in this regard, anomalies corresponding to observations with 'small' depth. Supported by sound theoretical and computational developments in the recent decades, it has proven to be extremely useful, in particular in functional spaces. However, most approaches documented in the literature consist in evaluating independently the centrality of each point forming the time series and consequently exhibit a certain insensitivity to possible shape changes. In this paper, we propose a novel notion of functional depth based on the area of the convex hull of sampled curves, capturing gradual departures from centrality, even beyond the envelope of the data, in a natural fashion. We discuss practical relevance of commonly imposed axioms on functional depths and investigate which of them are satisfied by the notion of depth we promote here. Estimation and computational issues are also addressed and various numerical experiments provide empirical evidence of the relevance of the approach proposed.},

  abstract = {Current approaches for multi-horizon time series forecasting using recurrent neural networks (RNNs) focus on issuing point estimates, which is insufficient for decision-making in critical application domains where an uncertainty estimate is also required. Existing approaches for uncertainty quantification in RNN-based time-series forecasts are limited as they may require significant alterations to the underlying model architecture, may be computationally complex, may be difficult to calibrate, may incur high sample complexity, and may not provide theoretical guarantees on frequentist coverage. In this paper, we extend the inductive conformal prediction framework to the time-series forecasting setup, and propose a lightweight algorithm to address all of the above limitations, providing uncertainty estimates with theoretical guarantees for any multi-horizon forecast predictor and any dataset with minimal exchangeability assumptions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by comparing it with existing benchmarks on a variety of synthetic and real-world datasets.},

We show how a type of linearly activated recurrent neural networks, which we call predictive neural networks, can approximate any time-dependent function f(t) given by a number of function values. The approximation can effectively be learned by simply solving a linear equation system; no backpropagation or similar methods are needed. Furthermore, the network size can be reduced by taking only most relevant components. Thus, in contrast to others, our approach not only learns network weights but also the network architecture. The networks have interesting properties: They end up in ellipse trajectories in the long run and allow the prediction of further values and compact representations of functions. We demonstrate this by several experiments, among them multiple superimposed oscillators (MSO), robotic soccer, and predicting stock prices. Predictive neural networks outperform the previous state-of-the-art for the MSO task with a minimal number of units.},

In this context, proposed reconciliation or end-to-end learning approaches assume coherent historical observations by construction; this assumption, however, is often violated in practice due to equipment failures. This work proposes an end-to-end learning approach for hierarchical forecasting that directly handles missing values. First, we show that a class of off-the-shelf machine learning algorithms already leads to coherent hierarchical forecasts. Next, we describe a conditional stochastic optimization approach based on prescriptive trees for end-to-end learning with missing values, without imputation or disregarding of quality observations. We validate the proposed approach in two case studies comprising 60 wind turbines and 20 photovoltaic parks, respectively. The empirical results show that end-to-end learning outperforms twostep reconciliation approaches and that the proposed solution mitigates the adverse effect of missing values.},

Building upon this intuition, we propose a new model that solely consists of attention layers. More precisely, we augment the self-attention layers with persistent memory vectors that play a similar role as the feed-forward layer. Thanks to these vectors, we can remove the feed-forward layer without degrading the performance of a transformer. Our evaluation shows the benefits brought by our model on standard character and word level language modeling benchmarks.},

It can also be seen as an extension of RNNsearch [2] to the case where multiple computational steps (hops) are performed per output symbol. The flexibility of the model allows us to apply it to tasks as diverse as (synthetic) question answering [22] and to language modeling. For the former our approach is competitive with Memory Networks, but with less supervision. For the latter, on the Penn TreeBank and Text8 datasets our approach demonstrates comparable performance to RNNs and LSTMs. In both cases we show that the key concept of multiple computational hops yields improved results.},

Making predictions on these time series has become a critical challenge due to not only the large-scale and high-dimensional nature but also the considerable amount of missing data. In this paper, we propose a Bayesian temporal factorization (BTF) framework for modeling multidimensional time series---in particular spatiotemporal data---in the presence of missing values. By integrating low-rank matrix/tensor factorization and vector autoregressive (VAR) process into a single probabilistic graphical model, this framework can characterize both global and local consistencies in large-scale time series data. The graphical model allows us to effectively perform probabilistic predictions and produce uncertainty estimates without imputing those missing values. We develop efficient Gibbs sampling algorithms for model inference and test the proposed BTF framework on several real-world spatiotemporal data sets for both missing data imputation and short-term/long-term rolling prediction tasks. The numerical experiments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed BTF approaches over many state-of-the-art techniques.},

Although DNNs work well whenever large labeled training sets are available, they cannot be used to map sequences to sequences. In this paper, we present a general end-to-end approach to sequence learning that makes minimal assumptions on the sequence structure. Our method uses a multilayered Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) to map the input sequence to a vector of a fixed dimensionality, and then another deep LSTM to decode the target sequence from the vector. Our main result is that on an English to French translation task from the WMT'14 dataset, the translations produced by the LSTM achieve a BLEU score of 34.8 on the entire test set, where the LSTM's BLEU score was penalized on out-of-vocabulary words. Additionally, the LSTM did not have difficulty on long sentences. For comparison, a phrase-based SMT system achieves a BLEU score of 33.3 on the same dataset. When we used the LSTM to rerank the 1000 hypotheses produced by the aforementioned SMT system, its BLEU score increases to 36.5, which is close to the previous best result on this task. The LSTM also learned sensible phrase and sentence representations that are sensitive to word order and are relatively invariant to the active and the passive voice. Finally, we found that reversing the order of the words in all source sentences (but not target sentences) improved the LSTM's performance markedly, because doing so introduced many short term dependencies between the source and the target sentence which made the optimization problem easier.},

Choosing between these two strategies is not an easy task since it involves a trade-off between bias and estimation variance over the forecast horizon. Using a nonlinear machine learning model makes the tradeoff even more difficult. To address this issue, we propose a new forecasting strategy which boosts traditional recursive linear forecasts with a direct strategy using a boosting autoregression procedure at each horizon. First, we investigate the performance of the proposed strategy in terms of bias and variance decomposition of the error using simulated time series. Then, we evaluate the proposed strategy on real-world time series from two forecasting competitions. Overall, we obtain excellent performance with respect to the standard forecasting strategies.},

  abstract = {Smart electricity meters are currently deployed in millions of households to collect detailed individual electricity consumption data. Compared with traditional electricity data based on aggregated consumption, smart meter data are much more volatile and less predictable. There is a need within the energy industry for probabilistic forecasts of household electricity consumption to quantify the uncertainty of future electricity demand in order to undertake appropriate planning of generation and distribution. We propose to estimate an additive quantile regression model for a set of quantiles of the future distribution using a boosting procedure. By doing so, we can benefit from flexible and interpretable models, which include an automatic variable selection. We compare our approach with three benchmark methods on both aggregated and disaggregated scales using a smart meter data set collected from 3639 households in Ireland at 30-min intervals over a period of 1.5 years. The empirical results demonstrate that our approach based on quantile regression provides better forecast accuracy for disaggregated demand, while the traditional approach based on a normality assumption (possibly after an appropriate Box-Cox transformation) is a better approximation for aggregated demand. These results are particularly useful since more energy data will become available at the disaggregated level in the future.},

  abstract = {Decisions regarding the supply of electricity across a power grid must take into consideration the inherent uncertainty in demand. Optimal decision-making requires probabilistic forecasts for demand in a hierarchy with various levels of aggregation, such as substations, cities, and regions. The forecasts should be coherent in the sense that the forecast of the aggregated series should equal the sum of the forecasts of the corresponding disaggregated series. Coherency is essential, since the allocation of electricity at one level of the hierarchy relies on the appropriate amount being provided from the previous level. We introduce a new probabilistic forecasting method for a large hierarchy based on UK residential smart meter data. We find our method provides coherent and accurate probabilistic forecasts, as a result of an effective forecast combination. Furthermore, by avoiding distributional assumptions, we find that our method captures the variety of distributions in the smart meter hierarchy. Finally, the results confirm that, to ensure coherency in our large-scale hierarchy, it is sufficient to model a set of lower-dimension dependencies, rather than modeling the entire joint distribution of all series in the hierarchy. In achieving coherent and accurate hierarchical probabilistic forecasts, this work contributes to improved decision-making for smart grids. Supplementary materials for this article, including a standardized description of the materials available for reproducing the work, are available as an online supplement.},

  abstract = {A large body of the forecasting literature so far has been focused on forecasting the conditional mean of future observations. However, there is an increasing need for generating the entire conditional distribution of future observations in order to effectively quantify the uncertainty in time series data. We present two different methods for probabilistic time series forecasting that allow the inclusion of a possibly large set of exogenous variables. One method is based on forecasting both the conditional mean and variance of the future distribution using a traditional regression approach. The other directly computes multiple quantiles of the future distribution using quantile regression. We propose an implementation for the two methods based on boosted additive models, which enjoy many useful properties including accuracy, flexibility, interpretability and automatic variable selection. We conduct extensive experiments using electricity smart meter data, on both aggregated and disaggregated scales, to compare the two forecasting methods for the challenging problem of forecasting the distribution of future electricity consumption. The empirical results demonstrate that the mean and variance forecasting provides better forecasts for aggregated demand, while the flexibility of the quantile regression approach is more suitable for disaggregated demand. These results are particularly useful since more energy data will become available at the disaggregated level in the future.},

State-of the art forecasting methods usually apply adjustments on the individual level forecasts to satisfy the aggregation constraints. These adjustments require the estimation of the covariance between the individual forecast errors at all aggregation levels. In order to keep a maximum number of individual forecasts unaffected by estimation errors, we propose a new forecasting algorithm that provides sparse and smooth adjustments while still preserving the aggregation constraints. The algorithm computes the revised forecasts by solving a generalized lasso problem. It is shown that it not only provides accurate forecasts, but also applies a significantly smaller number of adjustments to the base forecasts in a large-scale smart meter dataset.},

Sometimes one wants to obtain a good estimate that satisfies the property that a proportion, {$\tau$}, of y|x, will be below the estimate. For {$\tau$} = 0.5 this is an estimate of the median. What might be called median regression, is subsumed under the term quantile regression. We present a nonparametric version of a quantile estimator, which can be obtained by solving a simple quadratic programming problem and provide uniform convergence statements and bounds on the quantile property of our estimator. Experimental results show the feasibility of the approach and competitiveness of our method with existing ones. We discuss several types of extensions including an approach to solve the quantile crossing problems, as well as a method to incorporate prior qualitative knowledge such as monotonicity constraints.},

  abstract = {Recommender systems in industry generally include two stages: recall and ranking. Recall refers to efficiently identify hundreds of candidate items that user may interest in from a large volume of item corpus, while the latter aims to output a precise ranking list using complex ranking models. Recently, graph representation learning has attracted much attention in supporting high quality candidate search at scale. Despite its effectiveness in learning embedding vectors for objects in the user-item interaction network, the computational costs to infer users' preferences in continuous embedding space are tremendous. In this work, we investigate the problem of hashing with graph neural networks (GNNs) for high quality retrieval, and propose a simple yet effective discrete representation learning framework to jointly learn continuous and discrete codes. Specifically, a deep hashing with GNNs (HashGNN) is presented, which consists of two components, a GNN encoder for learning node representations, and a hash layer for encoding representations to hash codes. The whole architecture is trained end-to-end by jointly optimizing two losses, i.e., reconstruction loss from reconstructing observed links, and ranking loss from preserving the relative ordering of hash codes. A novel discrete optimization strategy based on straight through estimator (STE) with guidance is proposed. The principal idea is to avoid gradient magnification in back-propagation of STE with continuous embedding guidance, in which we begin from learning an easier network that mimic the continuous embedding and let it evolve during the training until it finally goes back to STE. Comprehensive experiments over three publicly available and one real-world Alibaba company datasets demonstrate that our model not only can achieve comparable performance compared with its continuous counterpart but also runs multiple times faster during inference.},

  abstract = {Multivariate time series (MTS) forecasting is widely used in various domains, such as meteorology and traffic. Due to limitations on data collection, transmission, and storage, real-world MTS data usually contains missing values, making it infeasible to apply existing MTS forecasting models such as linear regression and recurrent neural networks. Though many efforts have been devoted to this problem, most of them solely rely on local dependencies for imputing missing values, which ignores global temporal dynamics. Local dependencies/patterns would become less useful when the missing ratio is high, or the data have consecutive missing values; while exploring global patterns can alleviate such problems. Thus, jointly modeling local and global temporal dynamics is very promising for MTS forecasting with missing values. However, work in this direction is rather limited. Therefore, we study a novel problem of MTS forecasting with missing values by jointly exploring local and global temporal dynamics. We propose a new framework LGnet, which leverages memory network to explore global patterns given estimations from local perspectives. We further introduce adversarial training to enhance the modeling of global temporal distribution. Experimental results on real-world datasets show the effectiveness of LGnet for MTS forecasting with missing values and its robustness under various missing ratios.},

However, this theoretical argument has not been tested empirically, nor have alternative explanations for their strong performance been explored in-depth. We hypothesize that the strong performance of CNNs and self-attentional networks could also be due to their ability to extract semantic features from the source text, and we evaluate RNNs, CNNs and self-attention networks on two tasks: subject-verb agreement (where capturing long-range dependencies is required) and word sense disambiguation (where semantic feature extraction is required). Our experimental results show that: 1) self-attentional networks and CNNs do not outperform RNNs in modeling subject-verb agreement over long distances; 2) self-attentional networks perform distinctly better than RNNs and CNNs on word sense disambiguation.},

By encouraging specific sets of weights to be zero\textemdash in particular through the use of convex group-lasso penalties\textemdash we can extract the Granger causal structure. To further contrast with traditional approaches, our framework naturally enables us to efficiently capture long-range dependencies between series either via our RNNs or through an automatic lag selection in the MLP. We show that our neural Granger causality methods outperform state-of-the-art nonlinear Granger causality methods on the DREAM3 challenge data. This data consists of nonlinear gene expression and regulation time courses with only a limited number of time points. The successes we show in this challenging dataset provide a powerful example of how deep learning can be useful in cases that go beyond prediction on large datasets.

Besides, the inherent temporal dynamics of exogenous data are also related to the target series prediction, and thus should be considered as well. To address these issues, we propose an end-to-end deep learning model, i.e., Hierarchical attention-based Recurrent Highway Network (HRHN), which incorporates spatio-temporal feature extraction of exogenous variables and temporal dynamics modeling of target variables into a single framework. Moreover, by introducing the hierarchical attention mechanism, HRHN can adaptively select the relevant exogenous features in different semantic levels. We carry out comprehensive empirical evaluations with various methods over several datasets, and show that HRHN outperforms the state of the arts in time series prediction, especially in capturing sudden changes and sudden oscillations of time series.},

In addition to point predictions, interval forecasts are needed to set appropriate levels of safety stock.

These features motivate the consideration of forecasting methods that are robust with regard to distributional assumptions. The widespread use of exponential smoothing for point forecasting in inventory control motivates the development of the approach for interval forecasting. In this paper, we construct interval forecasts from quantile predictions generated using exponentially weighted quantile regression. The approach amounts to exponential smoothing of the cumulative distribution function, and can be viewed as an extension of generalised exponential smoothing to quantile forecasting. Empirical results are encouraging, with improvements over traditional methods being particularly apparent when the approach is used as the basis for robust point forecasting.},

However, whether the findings of the M5 competition can be generalized and exploited by retail firms to better support their decisions and operation depends on the extent to which the M5 data is sufficiently similar to unit sales data of retailers that operate in different regions, sell different types of products, and consider different marketing strategies. To answer this question, we analyze the characteristics of the M5 time series and compare them with those of two grocery retailers, namely Corporaci\textbackslash 'on Favorita and a major Greek supermarket chain, using feature spaces. Our results suggest that there are only small discrepancies between the examined data sets, supporting the representativeness of the M5 data.},

  abstract = {In time series analysis and forecasting, the identification of an appropriate model remains a challenging task. Model misspecification can lead to erroneous forecasts and insights. The use of multiple views of the same time series by constructing temporally aggregate levels has been proposed as a way to overcome the model specification and selection uncertainty, with ample empirical evidence of forecast accuracy gains. Temporal Hierarchies is the most popular approach to achieve this, which itself is based on research in hierarchical forecasting. Although there has been substantial progress in this literature, the vast majority of methods rely on a restricted linear combination of different model outputs across the hierarchy. We investigate the use of deep learning to augment temporal hierarchies, relaxing the classical restrictions. Specifically, we look at deep learning for the generation of all the base forecasts, the hierarchical reconciliation, and an end-to-end method that embeds all steps in a single neural network. We inspect the performance of the proposed methods when applied to individual time series, or with global training across complete sets of series. We further investigate the requirements in terms of series set size, illustrating the conditions where deep learning temporal hierarchies outperform conventional temporal hierarchies.},

An extension to the proposed algorithm, named UVB-IS, allows the user to trade accuracy for a substantial increase in computational speed through the use of importance sampling. The two methods and their properties are detailed in two separate simulation studies. Two empirical illustrations of the proposed UVB methods are provided, including one where a Dirichlet Process Mixture model with a novel posterior dependence structure is repeatedly updated in the context of predicting the future behaviour of vehicles on a stretch of the US Highway 101.},

We study the effect on accuracy and the computational cost of these alternatives. The experiments carried out on 11 data sets revealed that it is possible to significantly outperform the ``naive'' averages of regression trees. Among the four alternative models that we evaluated, kernel regressors were usually the best in terms of accuracy. Our study also indicates that by integrating regression trees with other regression approaches we are able to overcome the limitations of individual methods both in terms of accuracy as well as in computational efficiency.},

  abstract = {Estimating a covariance matrix is an important task in applications where the number of variables is larger than the number of observations. In the literature, shrinkage approaches for estimating a high-dimensional covariance matrix are employed to circumvent the limitations of the sample covariance matrix. A new family of nonparametric Stein-type shrinkage covariance estimators is proposed whose members are written as a convex linear combination of the sample covariance matrix and of a predefined invertible target matrix. Under the Frobenius norm criterion, the optimal shrinkage intensity that defines the best convex linear combination depends on the unobserved covariance matrix and it must be estimated from the data. A simple but effective estimation process that produces nonparametric and consistent estimators of the optimal shrinkage intensity for three popular target matrices is introduced. In simulations, the proposed Stein-type shrinkage covariance matrix estimator based on a scaled identity matrix appeared to be up to 80\% more efficient than existing ones in extreme high-dimensional settings. A colon cancer dataset was analyzed to demonstrate the utility of the proposed estimators. A rule of thumb for adhoc selection among the three commonly used target matrices is recommended.},

  abstract = {Multivariate Time Series (MTS) modeling has received significant attention in the last decade because of the complex nature of the data. Efficient representations are required to deal with the high dimensionality due to the increase in the number of variables and duration of the time series in different applications. For example, model-based approaches such as Hidden Markov Models (HMM) or autoregressive (AR) models focus on finding a model to represent the series with the model parameters to handle this problem. Both HMM and AR models are known to be very successful in the representation of the time series however most of the HMM approaches assume independence and traditional AR models consider linear dependence between the variables of MTS. As most of the real systems exhibit nonlinear relations, traditional approaches fail to represent the time series. To handle these problems, we propose an autoregressive tree-based ensemble approach that can model the nonlinear behavior embedded in the time series with the help of tree-based learning. Multivariate autoregressive forest, namely mv-ARF, is a nonparametric vector autoregression approach which provides an easy and efficient representation that scales well with large datasets. An error-based representation based on the learned models is the basis of the proposed approach. This is very similar to time series kernels used for multivariate time series classification problems. We test mv-ARF on MTS classification problems and show that mv-ARF provides fast and competitive results on benchmark datasets from several domains. Furthermore, mv-ARF provides a research direction for vector autoregressive models that breaks from the linear dependency models to potentially foster other promising nonlinear approaches.},

Here, we review the topic of predictive uncertainty estimation with machine learning algorithms, as well as the related metrics (consistent scoring functions and proper scoring rules) for assessing probabilistic predictions. The review covers a time period spanning from the introduction of early statistical (linear regression and time series models, based on Bayesian statistics or quantile regression) to recent machine learning algorithms (including generalized additive models for location, scale and shape, random forests, boosting and deep learning algorithms) that are more flexible by nature. The review of the progress in the field, expedites our understanding on how to develop new algorithms tailored to users' needs, since the latest advancements are based on some fundamental concepts applied to more complex algorithms.

Decades of research have resulted into an enormous amount of forecasting methods that stem from statistics, econometrics and machine learning (ML), which leads to a very difficult and elaborate choice to make in any forecasting exercise. This paper aims to facilitate this process for high-level tactical sales forecasts by comparing a large array of techniques for 35 times series that consist of both industry data from the Coca-Cola Company and publicly available datasets. However, instead of solely focusing on the accuracy of the resulting forecasts, this paper introduces a novel and completely automated profit-driven approach that takes into account the expected profit that a technique can create during both the model building and evaluation process. The expected profit function that is used for this purpose, is easy to understand and adaptable to any situation by combining forecasting accuracy with business expertise. Furthermore, we examine the added value of ML techniques, the inclusion of external factors and the use of seasonal models in order to ascertain which type of model works best in tactical sales forecasting. Our findings show that simple seasonal time series models consistently outperform other methodologies and that the profit-driven approach can lead to selecting a different forecasting model.},

This hierarchical relation implies one or more aggregate consistency constraints that the series are known to satisfy. Many existing approaches, like for example bottom-up or top-down forecasting, therefore attempt to achieve this goal in a way that guarantees that the forecasts will also be aggregate consistent. We propose to split the problem of HTS into two independent steps: first one comes up with the best possible forecasts for the time series without worrying about aggregate consistency; and then a reconciliation procedure is used to make the forecasts aggregate consistent. We introduce a Game-Theoretically OPtimal (GTOP) reconciliation method, which is guaranteed to only improve any given set of forecasts. This opens up new possibilities for constructing the forecasts. For example, it is not necessary to assume that bottom-level forecasts are unbiased, and aggregate forecasts may be constructed by regressing both on bottom-level forecasts and on other covariates that may only be available at the aggregate level. We illustrate the benefits of our approach both on simulated data and on real electricity consumption data.},

By incorporating the information about the underlying metric space of the pixel layout, the Wasserstein metric is an attractive choice as a regularizer to undercover spatiotemporal trends in time series data. We introduce a globally optimal algorithm for efficiently estimating the filtered signal under a Wasserstein finite differences operator. The efficacy of the proposed algorithm in preserving spatiotemporal trends in time series video is demonstrated in both simulated and fluorescent microscopy videos of the nematode caenorhabditis elegans and compared against standard trend filtering algorithms.},

  abstract = {Time series forecasting plays an important role in many decision support systems, also in those related to the management of supply chains. Forecast accuracy is, therefore, essential to optimise the efficiency of any supply chain. One aspect that is often overlooked is the fact that sales of many products within an organization are assembled as complex hierarchies with different levels of aggregation. Very often forecasts are produced regardless of such structure, though forecasting accuracy may be improved by taking it into account. In this paper, an approach for hierarchical time series forecasting based on State Space modelling is proposed. Previous developments provide solutions to the hierarchical forecasting problem by algebra manipulations based on forecasts produced by independent models for each time series involved in the hierarchy. The solutions produce optimal reconciled forecasts for each individual forecast horizon, but the link along time that is implied by the dynamics of the models is completely ignored. Therefore, the novel approach in this paper improves upon past research at least in two key points. Firstly, the algebra is already encoded in the State Space system and the Kalman Filter algorithm, giving an elegant and clean solution to the problem. Secondly, the State Space approach is optimal both across the hierarchy, as expected, but also along time, something missing in past developments. The approach is assessed by comparing its forecasting performance to the existing methods, through simulations and using real data of a Spanish grocery retailer.},

Firstly, the algebra is already encoded in the State Space system and the Kalman Filter algorithm, giving an elegant and clean solution to the problem. Secondly, the State Space approach is optimal both across the hierarchy, as expected, but also along time, something missing in past developments. In addition, the present approach provides an unified treatment of top-down, bottom-up, middle-out and reconciled approaches reported in the literature; it generalizes the optimization of hierarchies by proposing combined hierarchies which integrate the previous categories at different segments of the hierarchy; and it allows for multiple hierarchies to be simultaneously adjusted. The approach is assessed by comparing its forecasting performance to the existing methods, through simulations and using real data of a Spanish grocery retailer.},

We propose a temporal attention layer that is capable of selecting the relevant information to perform various tasks, including data completion, key-frame detection and classification. The method uses the whole input sequence to calculate an attention value for each time step. This results in more focused attention values and more plausible visualisation than previous methods. We apply the proposed method to three different tasks. Experimental results show that the proposed network produces comparable results to a state of the art. In addition, the network provides better interpretability of the decision, that is, it generates more significant attention weight to related frames compared to similar techniques attempted in the past.},

Despite recent advances in important domains such as vision and language, the standard supervised deep learning paradigm does not offer a satisfactory solution for learning new concepts rapidly from little data. In this work, we employ ideas from metric learning based on deep neural features and from recent advances that augment neural networks with external memories. Our framework learns a network that maps a small labelled support set and an unlabelled example to its label, obviating the need for fine-tuning to adapt to new class types. We then define one-shot learning problems on vision (using Omniglot, ImageNet) and language tasks. Our algorithm improves one-shot accuracy on ImageNet from 87.6\% to 93.2\% and from 88.0\% to 93.8\% on Omniglot compared to competing approaches. We also demonstrate the usefulness of the same model on language modeling by introducing a one-shot task on the Penn Treebank.},

  abstract = {We introduce a new neural architecture to learn the conditional probability of an output sequence with elements that are discrete tokens corresponding to positions in an input sequence. Such problems cannot be trivially addressed by existent approaches such as sequence-to-sequence [1] and Neural Turing Machines [2], because the number of target classes in each step of the output depends on the length of the input, which is variable. Problems such as sorting variable sized sequences, and various combinatorial optimization problems belong to this class. Our model solves the problem of variable size output dictionaries using a recently proposed mechanism of neural attention. It differs from the previous attention attempts in that, instead of using attention to blend hidden units of an encoder to a context vector at each decoder step, it uses attention as a pointer to select a member of the input sequence as the output. We call this architecture a Pointer Net (Ptr-Net). We show Ptr-Nets can be used to learn approximate solutions to three challenging geometric problems \textendash{} finding planar convex hulls, computing Delaunay triangulations, and the planar Travelling Salesman Problem \textendash{} using training examples alone. Ptr-Nets not only improve over sequence-to-sequence with input attention, but also allow us to generalize to variable size output dictionaries. We show that the learnt models generalize beyond the maximum lengths they were trained on. We hope our results on these tasks will encourage a broader exploration of neural learning for discrete problems.},

Inspired by these results we propose a neural network based latent model called DropoutNet to address the cold start problem in recommender systems. Unlike existing approaches that incorporate additional content-based objective terms, we instead focus on the optimization and show that neural network models can be explicitly trained for cold start through dropout. Our model can be applied on top of any existing latent model effectively providing cold start capabilities, and full power of deep architectures. Empirically we demonstrate state-of-the-art accuracy on publicly available benchmarks. Code is available at https://github.com/layer6ai-labs/DropoutNet.},

Although such models are often `deterministic', these models suffer from a wide range of uncertainties. We argue that uncertainty quantification is crucial for computer model validation and reproducibility. We present a statistical framework, termed history matching, for performing global parameter search by comparing model output to the observed data. We employ Gaussian process (GP) emulators to produce fast predictions about model behaviour at the arbitrary input parameter settings allowing output uncertainty distributions to be calculated. History matching identifies sets of input parameters that give rise to acceptable matches between observed data and model output given our representation of uncertainties. Modellers could proceed by simulating computer models' outputs of interest at these identified parameter settings and producing a range of predictions. The variability in model results is crucial for inter-model comparison as well as model development. We illustrate the performance of emulation and history matching on a simple one-dimensional toy model and in application to a climate model., This article is part of the theme issue `Reliability and reproducibility in computational science: implementing verification, validation and uncertainty quantification in silico'.},

In the frequentist framework the impact of a lot of covariates with very different structures have been made possible. We propose Bayesian expectile regression based on the asymmetric normal distribution. This renders possible incorporating for example linear, nonlinear, spatial and random effects in one model. Furthermore a detailed inference on the estimated parameters can be conducted.

Classical time series models fail to capture complex patterns in the data, and multivariate techniques struggle to scale to large problem sizes. Their reliance on strong structural assumptions makes them data-efficient, and allows them to provide uncertainty estimates. The converse is true for models based on deep neural networks, which can learn complex patterns and dependencies given enough data. In this paper, we propose a hybrid model that incorporates the benefits of both approaches. Our new method is data-driven and scalable via a latent, global, deep component. It also handles uncertainty through a local classical model. We provide both theoretical and empirical evidence for the soundness of our approach through a necessary and sufficient decomposition of exchangeable time series into a global and a local part.

Combining multiple forecasts produced from the single (target) series is now widely used to improve accuracy through the integration of information gleaned from different sources, thereby mitigating the risk of identifying a single ``best'' forecast. Combination schemes have evolved from simple combination methods without estimation, to sophisticated methods involving time-varying weights, nonlinear combinations, correlations among components, and cross-learning. They include combining point forecasts, and combining probabilistic forecasts. This paper provides an up-to-date review of the extensive literature on forecast combinations, together with reference to available open-source software implementations. We discuss the potential and limitations of various methods and highlight how these ideas have developed over time. Some important issues concerning the utility of forecast combinations are also surveyed. Finally, we conclude with current research gaps and potential insights for future research.},

Various types of deep neural network models have been introduced to time series analysis, but the important frequency information is yet lack of effective modeling. In light of this, in this paper we propose a wavelet-based neural network structure called multilevel Wavelet Decomposition Network (mWDN) for building frequency-aware deep learning models for time series analysis. mWDN preserves the advantage of multilevel discrete wavelet decomposition in frequency learning while enables the fine-tuning of all parameters under a deep neural network framework. Based on mWDN, we further propose two deep learning models called Residual Classification Flow (RCF) and multi-frequecy Long Short-Term Memory (mLSTM) for time series classification and forecasting, respectively. The two models take all or partial mWDN decomposed sub-series in different frequencies as input, and resort to the back propagation algorithm to learn all the parameters globally, which enables seamless embedding of wavelet-based frequency analysis into deep learning frameworks. Extensive experiments on 40 UCR datasets and a real-world user volume dataset demonstrate the excellent performance of our time series models based on mWDN. In particular, we propose an importance analysis method to mWDN based models, which successfully identifies those time-series elements and mWDN layers that are crucially important to time series analysis. This indeed indicates the interpretability advantage of mWDN, and can be viewed as an indepth exploration to interpretable deep learning.},

Specifically, the framework is divided into training and testing phases. In the training part, we use a collection of time series to train a model to explore how time series features affect the interval forecasting accuracy of different forecasting methods, which makes our proposed framework interpretable in terms of the contribution of each feature to the models' uncertainty prediction. The effect analysis is further applied to assign weights to various benchmark methods with the purpose of reducing the uncertainty of the forecasts. In the testing part, we calculate the point forecasts and PIs of new series using the trained model and weight determination process obtained in the training phase. We illustrate that, whether in point or interval forecasts, our feature-based forecasting framework outperforms all individual benchmark methods and their simple equally weighted combination for different confidence levels on the M3 competition data with an improved computational efficiency.},

  abstract = {Predictions of time-series are widely used in different disciplines. We propose CoR, Sparse Gaussian Conditional Random Fields (SGCRF) on top of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), for problems of this kind. CoR gains advantages from both RNN and SGCRF. It can not only effectively represent the temporal correlations in observed data, but can also learn the structured information of the output. CoR is challenging to train because it is a hybrid of deep neural networks and densely-connected graphical models. Alternative training can be a tractable way to train CoR, and furthermore, an end-toend training method is proposed to train CoR more efficiently. CoR is evaluated by both synthetic data and real-world data, and it shows a significant improvement in performance over state-of-the-art methods.},

However, a common challenge is faced for adjusting forecasting models to fit the need for substations' load prediction as well as minimizing expenditure in IT resources for repurposing these forecasting models to bigger datasets. The goal of this paper is to propose a novel solution that is responsive to these demands through the integration of reinforcement learning with load forecasting on existing database technology. To deal with the varying accuracy of the forecasting models on different substations' loads, the proposed solution compares and uses the best models and recalibrate them iteratively by comparing the model's prediction against the actual load data. As shown in empirical analysis, the solution interacts with the environment and performs the optimum forecasting routine intuitively.},

  abstract = {Monotonic neural networks have recently been proposed as a way to define invertible transformations. These transformations can be combined into powerful autoregressive flows that have been shown to be universal approximators of continuous probability distributions. Architectures that ensure monotonicity typically enforce constraints on weights and activation functions, which enables invertibility but leads to a cap on the expressiveness of the resulting transformations. In this work, we propose the Unconstrained Monotonic Neural Network (UMNN) architecture based on the insight that a function is monotonic as long as its derivative is strictly positive. In particular, this latter condition can be enforced with a free-form neural network whose only constraint is the positiveness of its output. We evaluate our new invertible building block within a new autoregressive flow (UMNN-MAF) and demonstrate its e{$\carriagereturn$}ectiveness on density estimation experiments. We also illustrate the ability of UMNNs to improve variational inference.},

We define this as network morphism in this research. After morphing a parent network, the child network is expected to inherit the knowledge from its parent network and also has the potential to continue growing into a more powerful one with much shortened training time. The first requirement for this network morphism is its ability to handle diverse morphing types of networks, including changes of depth, width, kernel size, and even subnet. To meet this requirement, we first introduce the network morphism equations, and then develop novel morphing algorithms for all these morphing types for both classic and convolutional neural networks. The second requirement for this network morphism is its ability to deal with nonlinearity in a network. We propose a family of parametric-activation functions to facilitate the morphing of any continuous non-linear activation neurons. Experimental results on benchmark datasets and typical neural networks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed network morphism scheme.},

  abstract = {Over recent years, emerging interest has occurred in integrating computer vision technology into the retail industry. Automatic checkout (ACO) is one of the critical problems in this area which aims to automatically generate the shopping list from the images of the products to purchase. The main challenge of this problem comes from the large scale and the fine-grained nature of the product categories as well as the difficulty for collecting training images that reflect the realistic checkout scenarios due to continuous update of the products. Despite its significant practical and research value, this problem is not extensively studied in the computer vision community, largely due to the lack of a high-quality dataset. To fill this gap, in this work we propose a new dataset to facilitate relevant research. Our dataset enjoys the following characteristics: (1) It is by far the largest dataset in terms of both product image quantity and product categories. (2) It includes single-product images taken in a controlled environment and multi-product images taken by the checkout system. (3) It provides different levels of annotations for the check-out images. Comparing with the existing datasets, ours is closer to the realistic setting and can derive a variety of research problems. Besides the dataset, we also benchmark the performance on this dataset with various approaches. The dataset and related resources can be found at https://rpc-dataset.github.io/.},

  abstract = {This dissertation comprises of three original contributions to empirical forecasting research. Chapter 1 introduces the dissertation.  Chapter 2 contributes to the literature on hierarchical time series (HTS) modelling by proposing a disaggregated forecasting system for both inflation rate and its volatility. Using monthly data that underlies the Retail Prices Index for the UK, we analyse the dynamics of the inflation process. We examine patterns in the time-varying covariation among product-level inflation rates that aggregate up to industry-level inflation rates that in turn aggregate up to the overall inflation rate. The aggregate inflation volatility closely tracks the time path of this covariation, which is seen to be driven primarily by the variances of common shocks shared by all products, and by the covariances between idiosyncratic product-level shocks. We formulate a forecasting system that comprises of models for mean inflation rate and its variance, and exploit the index structure of the aggregate inflation rate using the HTS framework. Using a dynamic model selection approach to forecasting, we obtain forecasts that are between 9 and 155 \% more accurate than a SARIMA-GARCH(1,1) for the aggregate inflation volatility. Chapter 3 is on improving forecasts using forecast combinations. The paper documents the software implementation of the open source R package for forecast combination that we coded and published on the official R package depository, CRAN. The GeomComb package is the only R package that covers a wide range of different popular forecast combination methods. We implement techniques from 3 broad categories: (a) simple non-parametric methods, (b) regression-based methods, and (c) geometric (eigenvector) methods, allowing for static or dynamic estimation of each approach. Using S3 classes/methods in R, the package provides a user-friendly environment for applied forecasting, implementing solutions for typical issues related to forecast combination (multicollinearity, missing values, etc.), criterion-based optimisation for several parametric methods, and post-fit functions to rationalise and visualise estimation results. The package has been listed in the official R Task Views for Time Series Analysis and for Official Statistics. The brief empirical application in the paper illustrates the package's functionality by estimating forecast combination techniques for monthly UK electricity supply. Chapter 4 introduces HTS forecasting and forecast combination to a healthcare staffing context. A slowdown of healthcare budget growth in the UK that does not keep pace with growth of demand for hospital services made efficient cost planning increasingly crucial for hospitals, in particular for staff which accounts for more than half of hospitals' expenses. This is facilitated by accurate forecasts of patient census and churn. Using a dataset of more than 3 million observations from a large UK hospital, we show how HTS forecasting can improve forecast accuracy by using information at different levels of the hospital hierarchy (aggregate, emergency/electives, divisions, specialties), compared to the na\"ive benchmark: the seasonal random walk model applied to the aggregate. We show that forecast combination can improve accuracy even more in some cases, and leads to lower forecast error variance (decreasing forecasting risk). We propose a comprehensive parametric approach to use forecasts in a nurse staffing model that has the aim of minimising cost while satisfying that the care requirements (e.g. nurse hours per patient day thresholds) are met},

  abstract = {The sum of forecasts of a disaggregated time series are often required to equal the forecast of the aggregate. The least squares solution for finding coherent forecasts uses a reconciliation approach known as MinT, proposed by Wickramasuriya, Athanasopoulos and Hyndman (2019). The MinT approach and its variants do not guarantee that the coherent forecasts are nonnegative, even when all of the original forecasts are non-negative in nature. This has become a serious issue in applications that are inherently non-negative such as with sales data or tourism numbers. While overcoming this difficulty, we consider the analytical solution of MinT as a least squares minimization problem. The non-negativity constraints are then imposed on the minimization problem to ensure that the coherent forecasts are strictly non-negative. Considering the dimension and sparsity of the matrices involved, and the alternative representation of MinT, this constrained quadratic programming problem is solved using three algorithms. They are the block principal pivoting algorithm, projected conjugate gradient algorithm, and scaled gradient projection algorithm. A Monte Carlo simulation is performed to evaluate the computational performances of these algorithms. The results demonstrate that the block principal pivoting algorithm clearly outperforms the rest, and projected conjugate gradient is the second best. The superior performance of the block principal pivoting algorithm can be partially attributed to the alternative representation of the weight matrix in the MinT approach. An empirical investigation is carried out to assess the impact of imposing non-negativity constraints on forecast reconciliation. It is observed that slight gains in forecast accuracy have occurred at the most disaggregated level. At the aggregated level slight losses are also observed. Although the gains or losses are negligible, the procedure plays an important role in decision and policy implementation processes.},

In this paper we propose a novel approach to estimate the time-varying conditional variance of the GAM residuals, which we call the GAM\^2 algorithm. It allows utility companies and network operators to assess the uncertainty of future electricity demand and incorporate it into their planning processes. The basic idea of our algorithm is to apply another GAM to the squared residuals to explain the dependence of uncertainty on exogenous variables. Empirical evidence shows that the residuals rescaled by the estimated conditional variance are approximately normal. We combine our modeling approach with online learning algorithms that adjust for dynamic changes in the distributions of demand. We illustrate our method by a case study on data from RTE, the operator of the French transmission grid.},

  abstract = {In this study we focus on the application of Conformal Prediction (CP) interval estimations to provide financial Market Makers (MMs) with some ``meaningful'' forecasts relating to their future short-term position in a given financial market. The idea is that using these market position forecasts, MMs can deploy proactive risk management strategies with a given degree of confidence. We make use of a novel financial time series dataset that comprises the net positions of a given MM over a three year period for trades pertaining to the top-traded Foreign Exchange (FX) symbols. This dataset \textendash{} \textbackslash nolinebreak\{NetPositionTimeSeries\} \textendash{} is noisy and complex. The net positions within it are generated from the trades of tens of thousands of clients trading in different directions (buy or sell) and over many different time horizons. We approached the problem of predicting future net position not as one that required an accurate point estimate as this is impossible. Rather we sought to gain a meaningful range of possible position bounds which would nonetheless be invaluable. In this study we tested a range of predictive Machine Learning (ML) techniques. We compared the CP framework to benchmark methods like moving average (MA) and quantile regression (QR). We demonstrate how application of the CP framework gives well calibrated region bounds on the MM net position forecasts.},

Recent progress on deep autoregressive models has shown their ability to capture long-term dependencies of the sequence data. However, the shortage of available financial data for training will make the deep models susceptible to the overfitting problem. In this paper, we propose a neural-network-powered conditional mutual information (CMI) estimator for learning representations for the forecasting task. Specifically, we first train an encoder to maximize the mutual information between the latent variables and the label information conditioned on the encoded observed variables. Then the features extracted from the trained encoder are used to learn a subsequent logistic regression model for predicting time series movements. Our proposed estimator transforms the CMI maximization problem to a classification problem whether two encoded representations are sampled from the same class or not. This is equivalent to perform pairwise comparisons of the training datapoints, and thus, improves the generalization ability of the deep autoregressive model. Empirical experiments indicate that our proposed method has the potential to advance the state-of-the-art performance.},

This approach works by leveraging self-attention mechanisms to learn complex patterns and dynamics from time series data. Moreover, it is a generic framework and can be applied to univariate and multivariate time series data, as well as time series embeddings.

While some previous approaches have explored this direction, their results are still far from satisfactory due to their reliance on performance of sentiment analysis and limited capabilities of learning direct relations between target stock trends and their daily social texts. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel Cross-modal attention based Hybrid Recurrent Neural Network (CH-RNN), which is inspired by the recent proposed DA-RNN model. Specifically, CH-RNN consists of two essential modules. One adopts DA-RNN to gain stock trend representations for different stocks. The other utilizes recurrent neural network to model daily aggregated social texts. These two modules interact seamlessly by the following two manners: 1) daily representations of target stock trends from the first module are leveraged to select trend-related social texts through a cross-modal attention mechanism, and 2) representations of text sequences and trend series are further integrated. The comprehensive experiments on the real dataset we build demonstrate the effectiveness of CH-RNN and benefit of considering social texts.},

Current forecasting approaches often use only a single time resolution (e.g., daily or weekly), which truncates the range of observable temporal patterns. However, real-world behavioral time series typically exhibit patterns across multi-dimensional temporal patterns, yielding dependencies at each level. To fully exploit these underlying dynamics, this paper studies the forecasting problem for behavioral time series data with the consideration of multiple time resolutions and proposes a multi-resolution time series forecasting framework, RESolution-aware Time series Forecasting (RESTFul). In particular, we first develop a recurrent framework to encode the temporal patterns at each resolution. In the fusion process, a convolutional fusion framework is proposed, which is capable of learning conclusive temporal patterns for modeling behavioral time series data to predict future time steps. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that the RESTFul model significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art time series prediction techniques on both numerical and categorical behavioral time series data.},

In this way, the gradients of condition-specific variables could be worked out in the back-propagation process, approximately, making a fully functioned neural graph. Within our novel principle, we propose the neural decision tree (NDT), which takes simplified neural networks as decision function in each branch and employs complex neural networks to generate the output in each leaf.

  abstract = {Providing long-range forecasts is a fundamental challenge in time series modeling, which is only compounded by the challenge of having to form such forecasts when a time series has never previously been observed. The latter challenge is the time series version of the cold-start problem seen in recommender systems which, to our knowledge, has not been addressed in previous work. A similar problem occurs when a long range forecast is required after only observing a small number of time points \textemdash{} a warm start forecast. With these aims in mind, we focus on forecasting seasonal profiles\textemdash or baseline demand \textemdash for periods on the order of a year in three cases: the long range case with multiple previously observed seasonal profiles, the cold start case with no previous observed seasonal profiles, and the warm start case with only a single partially observed profile. Classical time series approaches that perform iterated step-ahead forecasts based on previous observations struggle to provide accurate long range predictions; in settings with little to no observed data, such approaches are simply not applicable. Instead, we present a straightforward framework which combines ideas from high-dimensional regression and matrix factorization on a carefully constructed data matrix. Key to our formulation and resulting performance is leveraging (1) repeated patterns over fixed periods of time and across series, and (2) metadata associated with the individual series; without this additional data, the cold-start/warm-start problems are nearly impossible to solve. We demonstrate that our framework can accurately forecast an array of seasonal profiles on multiple large scale datasets.},

This paper extends the discussion into probability space, and studies how reconciliation can affect the performance of probabilistic forecasting. More specifically, qualities of the parametric predictive distributions before and after reconciliation are compared. Four minimum-trace-based reconciliation techniques are used to reconcile day-ahead and hour-ahead forecasts generated using two datasets: (1) distributed solar power generation for 318 simulated PV systems in California, and (2) satellite-derived irradiance over Arizona. The empirical result shows that reconciliation not only improves the accuracy of point forecasts, but also leads to high-quality predictive distributions in terms of sharpness, calibration, and skill score. Moreover, such improvement is quite general, and does not seem to depend on data, hierarchy structure, nor the underlying forecasting model.},

  abstract = {Conformal prediction is a generic methodology for finite-sample valid distribution-free prediction. This technique has garnered a lot of attention in the literature partly because it can be applied with any machine learning algorithm that provides point predictions to yield valid prediction regions. Of course, the efficiency (width/volume) of the resulting prediction region depends on the performance of the machine learning algorithm. In this paper, we consider the problem of obtaining the smallest conformal prediction region given a family of machine learning algorithms. We provide two general-purpose selection algorithms and consider coverage as well as width properties of the final prediction region. The first selection method yields the smallest width prediction region among the family of conformal prediction regions for all sample sizes, but only has an approximate coverage guarantee. The second selection method has a finite sample coverage guarantee but only attains close to the smallest width. The approximate optimal width property of the second method is quantified via an oracle inequality. Asymptotic oracle inequalities are also considered when the family of algorithms is given by ridge regression with different penalty parameters.},

In this paper, we calibrate the distribution of these few-sample classes by transferring statistics from the classes with sufficient examples, then an adequate number of examples can be sampled from the calibrated distribution to expand the inputs to the classifier. We assume every dimension in the feature representation follows a Gaussian distribution so that the mean and the variance of the distribution can borrow from that of similar classes whose statistics are better estimated with an adequate number of samples. Our method can be built on top of off-the-shelf pretrained feature extractors and classification models without extra parameters. We show that a simple logistic regression classifier trained using the features sampled from our calibrated distribution can outperform the state-of-theart accuracy on two datasets (5\% improvement on miniImageNet compared to the next best). The visualization of these generated features demonstrates that our calibrated distribution is an accurate estimation.},

  abstract = {Hierarchical time series is a set of time series organized by aggregation constraints and it is widely used in many real-world applications. Usually, hierarchical time series forecasting can be realized with a two-step method, in which all time series are forecasted independently and then the forecasting results are reconciled to satisfy aggregation consistency. However, these two-step methods have a high computational complexity and are unable to ensure optimal forecasts for all time series. In this paper, we propose a novel hierarchical forecasting approach to solve the above problems. Based on multi-task learning, we construct an integrated model that combines features of the bottom level series and the hierarchical structure. Then forecasts of all time series are output simultaneously and they are aggregated consistently. The model has the advantage of utilizing the correlation between time series. And the forecasting results are overall optimal by optimizing a global loss function. In order to avoid the curse of dimensionality as the number of time series grows larger, we further learn a sparse model with group sparsity and element-wise sparsity constraints according to data characteristics. The experimental results on simulation data and tourism data demonstrate that our method has a better overall performance while simplifying forecasting process.},

We propose an improved approach that connects the high-impact value of remarkably long sequence time steps to the current time step, and these high-impact traffic flow values are captured using the attention mechanism. At the same time, we smooth out some data beyond the normal range to obtain better prediction results.

Making a prediction of such noisy time series constitutes a problem of learning the nonlinear time evolution of a probability distribution. Capability of most of the conventional time series models is limited when the underlying dynamics is nonlinear, multi-scale or when there is no prior knowledge at all on the system dynamics. We propose DE-RNN (Density Estimation Recurrent Neural Network) to learn the probability density function (PDF) of a stochastic process with an underlying nonlinear dynamics and compute the time evolution of the PDF for a probabilistic forecast. A Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)-based model is employed to learn a nonlinear operator for the temporal evolution of the stochastic process. We use a softmax layer for a numerical discretization of a smooth PDF, which transforms a function approximation problem to a classification task. A regularized cross-entropy method is introduced to impose a smoothness condition on the estimated probability distribution. A Monte Carlo procedure to compute the temporal evolution of the distribution for a multiple-step forecast is presented. It is shown that the proposed algorithm can learn the nonlinear multi-scale dynamics from the noisy observations and provides an effective tool to forecast time evolution of the underlying probability distribution. Evaluation of the algorithm on three synthetic and two real data sets shows advantage over the compared baselines, and a potential value to a wide range of problems in physics and engineering.},

  abstract = {The ability to forecast a set of likely yet diverse possible future behaviors of an agent (e.g., future trajectories of a pedestrian) is essential for safety-critical perception systems (e.g., autonomous vehicles). In particular, a set of possible future behaviors generated by the system must be diverse to account for all possible outcomes in order to take necessary safety precautions. It is not sufficient to maintain a set of the most likely future outcomes because the set may only contain perturbations of a single outcome. While generative models such as variational autoencoders (VAEs) have been shown to be a powerful tool for learning a distribution over future trajectories, randomly drawn samples from the learned implicit likelihood model may not be diverse -- the likelihood model is derived from the training data distribution and the samples will concentrate around the major mode that has most data. In this work, we propose to learn a diversity sampling function (DSF) that generates a diverse and likely set of future trajectories. The DSF maps forecasting context features to a set of latent codes which can be decoded by a generative model (e.g., VAE) into a set of diverse trajectory samples. Concretely, the process of identifying the diverse set of samples is posed as a parameter estimation of the DSF. To learn the parameters of the DSF, the diversity of the trajectory samples is evaluated by a diversity loss based on a determinantal point process (DPP). Gradient descent is performed over the DSF parameters, which in turn move the latent codes of the sample set to find an optimal diverse and likely set of trajectories. Our method is a novel application of DPPs to optimize a set of items (trajectories) in continuous space. We demonstrate the diversity of the trajectories produced by our approach on both low-dimensional 2D trajectory data and high-dimensional human motion data.},

The stochastic nature of the demand for electricity, along with parameters such as temperature, humidity, and work habits, eventually causes deviations from expected demand. In this paper, we propose a feedback-based forecasting methodology in which the hourly prediction by a Fourier series expansion is updated by using the error at the current hour for the forecast at the next hour. The proposed methodology is applied to the Turkish power market for the period 2012\textendash 2017 and provides a powerful tool to forecasts the demand in hourly, daily and yearly horizons using only the past demand data. The hourly forecasting errors in the demand, in the Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) norm, are 0.87\% in hour-ahead, 2.90\% in day-ahead, and 3.54\% in year-ahead horizons, respectively. An autoregressive (AR) model is also applied to the predictions by the Fourier series expansion to obtain slightly better results. As predictions are updated on an hourly basis using the already realized data for the current hour, the model can be considered as reliable and practical in circumstances needed to make bidding and dispatching decisions.},

We theoretically analyse the impact of the learning rate on its efficiency in the exchangeable and auto-regressive case. We propose a parameter-free method, AgACI, that adaptively builds upon ACI based on online expert aggregation. We lead extensive fair simulations against competing methods that advocate for ACI's use in time series. We conduct a real case study: electricity price forecasting. The proposed aggregation algorithm provides efficient prediction intervals for day-ahead forecasting. All the code and data to reproduce the experiments are made available on GitHub.},

  abstract = {The continuous ranked probability score (CRPS) is a much used measure of performance for probabilistic forecasts of a scalar observation. It is a quadratic measure of the difference between the forecast cumulative distribution function (CDF) and the empirical CDF of the observation. Analytic formulations of the CRPS can be derived for most classical parametric distributions, and be used to assess the efficiency of different CRPS estimators. When the true forecast CDF is not fully known, but represented as an ensemble of values, the CRPS is estimated with some error. Thus, using the CRPS to compare parametric probabilistic forecasts with ensemble forecasts may be misleading due to the unknown error of the estimated CRPS for the ensemble. With simulated data, the impact of the type of the verified ensemble (a random sample or a set of quantiles) on the CRPS estimation is studied. Based on these simulations, recommendations are issued to choose the most accurate CRPS estimator according to the type of ensemble. The interest of these recommendations is illustrated with real ensemble weather forecasts. Also, relationships between several estimators of the CRPS are demonstrated and used to explain the differences of accuracy between the estimators.},

Several technologies have been integrated to reduce power consumption. A predictive module, based on artificial neural networks (ANNs), has been developed using data acquired in Valencia. The module produces short-term forecast of indoor temperature, using as input data captured by a complex monitoring system. The system expects to reduce the power consumption related to Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) system, due to the following assumptions: the high power consumption for which HVAC is responsible (53.9\% of the overall consumption); and the energy needed to maintain temperature is less than the energy required to lower/increase it. This paper studies the development viability of predictive systems for a totally unknown environment applying on-line learning techniques. The model parameters are estimated starting from a totally random model or from an unbiased a priori knowledge. These forecasting measures could allow the house to adapt itself to future temperature conditions by using home automation in an energy-efficient manner. Experimental results show reasonable forecasting accuracy with simple models, and in relatively short training time (4\textendash 5 days).},

More precisely, it is demonstrated that this model is a universal approximator, with respect to learning the unknown prediction function. This statement is strengthened as upper bounds on the mean squared error are established. Based on these results it is possible to compare the MEM to other families of models (e.g., neural networks and state dependent models). It is shown that a degenerate version of the MEM is in fact equivalent to a neural network, and the number of experts in the architecture plays a similar role to the number of hidden units in the latter model.},

For an advertiser, the campaign information is incomplete --- the user responses (e.g, clicks or conversions) and the market price of each ad impression are observed only if the advertiser's bid had won the corresponding ad auction. The predictions, such as bid landscape forecasting, click-through rate (CTR) estimation, and bid optimisation, are all operated in the pre-bid stage with full-volume bid request data. However, the training data is gathered in the post-bid stage with a strong bias towards the winning impressions. A common solution for learning over such censored data is to reweight data instances to correct the discrepancy between training and prediction. However, little study has been done on how to obtain the weights independent of previous bidding strategies and consequently integrate them into the final CTR prediction and bid generation steps. In this paper, we formulate CTR estimation and bid optimisation under such censored auction data. Derived from a survival model, we show that historic bid information is naturally incorporated to produce Bid-aware Gradient Descents (BGD) which controls both the importance and the direction of the gradient to achieve unbiased learning. The empirical study based on two large-scale real-world datasets demonstrates remarkable performance gains from our solution. The learning framework has been deployed on Yahoo!'s real-time bidding platform and provided 2.97\% AUC lift for CTR estimation and 9.30\% eCPC drop for bid optimisation in an online A/B test.},

  abstract = {Nowadays, multivariate time series data are increasingly collected in various real world systems, e.g., power plants, wearable devices, etc. Anomaly detection and diagnosis in multivariate time series refer to identifying abnormal status in certain time steps and pinpointing the root causes. Building such a system, however, is challenging since it not only requires to capture the temporal dependency in each time series, but also need encode the inter-correlations between different pairs of time series. In addition, the system should be robust to noise and provide operators with different levels of anomaly scores based upon the severity of different incidents. Despite the fact that a number of unsupervised anomaly detection algorithms have been developed, few of them can jointly address these challenges. In this paper, we propose a Multi-Scale Convolutional Recurrent Encoder-Decoder (MSCRED), to perform anomaly detection and diagnosis in multivariate time series data. Specifically, MSCRED first constructs multi-scale (resolution) signature matrices to characterize multiple levels of the system statuses in different time steps. Subsequently, given the signature matrices, a convolutional encoder is employed to encode the inter-sensor (time series) correlations and an attention based Convolutional Long-Short Term Memory (ConvLSTM) network is developed to capture the temporal patterns. Finally, based upon the feature maps which encode the inter-sensor correlations and temporal information, a convolutional decoder is used to reconstruct the input signature matrices and the residual signature matrices are further utilized to detect and diagnose anomalies. Extensive empirical studies based on a synthetic dataset and a real power plant dataset demonstrate that MSCRED can outperform state-ofthe-art baseline methods.},

Inspired by the iterative construction strategy for building a random multilayer perceptron, we propose a novel Error-feedback Stochastic Configuration (ESC) strategy to construct a random Convolutional Neural Network (ESC-CNN) for time series forecasting task, which builds the network architecture adaptively. The ESC strategy suggests that random filters and neurons of the error-feedback fully connected layer are incrementally added in a manner that they can steadily compensate the prediction error during the construction process, and a filter selection strategy is introduced to secure that ESC-CNN holds the universal approximation property, providing helpful information at each iterative process for the prediction. The performance of ESC-CNN is justified on its prediction accuracy for one-step-ahead and multi-step-ahead forecasting tasks. Comprehensive experiments on a synthetic dataset and two real-world datasets show that the proposed ESC-CNN not only outperforms the state-of-art random neural networks, but also exhibits strong predictive power in comparison to trained Convolution Neural Networks and Long Short-Term Memory models, demonstrating the effectiveness of ESC-CNN in time series forecasting.},

By combining simple regression trees with `poor' performance, they usually produce high prediction accuracy. In contrast to other machine learning methods that have been treated as black-boxes, tree based ensemble methods provide interpretable results, while requiring little data preprocessing, are able to handle different types of predictor variables, and can fit complex nonlinear relationship. These properties make the tree based ensemble methods good candidates for solving travel time prediction problems. However, applications of tree-based ensemble algorithms in traffic prediction area are limited. In this paper, we employ a gradient boosting regression tree method (GBM) to analyze and model freeway travel time to improve the prediction accuracy and model interpretability. The gradient boosting tree method strategically combines additional trees by correcting mistakes made by its previous base models, therefore, potentially improves prediction accuracy. Different parameters' effect on model performance and correlations of input\textendash output variables are discussed in details by using travel time data provided by INRIX along two freeway sections in Maryland. The proposed method is, then, compared with another popular ensemble method and a bench mark model. Study results indicate that the GBM model has its considerable advantages in freeway travel time prediction.},

At first, wind power generation at all levels of the hierarchy is independently forecasted using state-of-the-art techniques. Then, a least squares regression model is used to optimally reconcile these base forecasts. Adjusted forecasts are as close as possible to base forecasts but also satisfy the requirement of the aggregate consistency (i.e., the lower-level forecasts add up exactly to the higher-level forecasts). Case studies validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach for very short-term wind power forecasts. The accuracy improvement of reconciled forecasts over benchmarks is confirmed at all levels of the hierarchy, regardless of forecast horizons and hierarchical structures.},

Under this approach, base forecasts are produced for every series in the hierarchy and are subsequently adjusted to be coherent in a second reconciliation step. Reconciliation methods have been shown to improve forecast accuracy but will generally adjust the base forecast of every series. However, in an operational context, it is sometimes necessary or beneficial to keep forecasts of some variables unchanged after forecast reconciliation. In this paper, we formulate a reconciliation methodology that keeps forecasts of a pre-specified subset of variables unchanged or ``immutable''. In contrast to existing approaches, these immutable forecasts need not all come from the same level of a hierarchy, and our method can also be applied to grouped hierarchies. We prove that our approach preserves unbiasedness in base forecasts. Our method can also account for correlations between base forecasting errors and ensure the non-negativity of forecasts. We also perform empirical experiments, including an application to a large-scale online retailer's sales, to assess our proposed methodology's impacts.},

  abstract = {Contemporary power grids are being challenged by rapid voltage fluctuations that are caused by large-scale deployment of renewable generation, electric vehicles, and demand response programs. In this context, monitoring the grid's operating conditions in real time becomes increasingly critical. With the emergent large scale and nonconvexity however, the existing power system state estimation (PSSE) schemes become computationally expensive or yield suboptimal performance. To bypass these hurdles, this paper advocates deep neural networks (DNNs) for real-time power system monitoring. By unrolling an iterative physics-based prox-linear solver, a novel model-specific DNN is developed for real-time PSSE with affordable training and minimal tuning effort. To further enable system awareness even ahead of the time horizon, as well as to endow the DNN-based estimator with resilience, deep recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are also pursued for power system state forecasting. Deep RNNs leverage the long-term nonlinear dependencies present in the historical voltage time series to enable forecasting, and they are easy to implement. Numerical tests showcase improved performance of the proposed DNN-based estimation and forecasting approaches compared with existing alternatives. In real load data experiments on the IEEE 118-bus benchmark system, the novel model-specific DNN-based PSSE scheme outperforms nearly by an order-of-magnitude the competing alternatives, including the widely adopted Gauss-Newton PSSE solver.},

  abstract = {Many machine learning problems can be framed in the context of estimating functions, and often these are time-dependent functions that are estimated in real-time as observations arrive. Gaussian processes (GPs) are an attractive choice for modeling real-valued nonlinear functions due to their flexibility and uncertainty quantification. However, the typical GP regression model suffers from several drawbacks: i) Conventional GP inference scales \$O(N\^\{3\})\$ with respect to the number of observations; ii) updating a GP model sequentially is not trivial; and iii) covariance kernels often enforce stationarity constraints on the function, while GPs with non-stationary covariance kernels are often intractable to use in practice. To overcome these issues, we propose an online sequential Monte Carlo algorithm to fit mixtures of GPs that capture non-stationary behavior while allowing for fast, distributed inference. By formulating hyperparameter optimization as a multi-armed bandit problem, we accelerate mixing for real time inference. Our approach empirically improves performance over state-of-the-art methods for online GP estimation in the context of prediction for simulated non-stationary data and hospital time series data.},

  abstract = {Stock prices are formed based on short and/or long-term commercial and trading activities that reflect different frequencies of trading patterns. However, these patterns are often elusive as they are affected by many uncertain politicaleconomic factors in the real world, such as corporate performances, government policies, and even breaking news circulated across markets. Moreover, time series of stock prices are non-stationary and non-linear, making the prediction of future price trends much challenging. To address them, we propose a novel State Frequency Memory (SFM) recurrent network to capture the multi-frequency trading patterns from past market data to make long and short term predictions over time. Inspired by Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT), the SFM decomposes the hidden states of memory cells into multiple frequency components, each of which models a particular frequency of latent trading pattern underlying the fluctuation of stock price. Then the future stock prices are predicted as a nonlinear mapping of the combination of these components in an Inverse Fourier Transform (IFT) fashion. Modeling multi-frequency trading patterns can enable more accurate predictions for various time ranges: while a shortterm prediction usually depends on high frequency trading patterns, a long-term prediction should focus more on the low frequency trading patterns targeting at long-term return. Unfortunately, no existing model explicitly distinguishes between various frequencies of trading patterns to make dynamic predictions in literature. The experiments on the real market data also demonstrate more competitive performance by the SFM as compared with the state-of-the-art methods.},

While transformers have achieved outstanding performances in time series forecasting, they often require many training samples due to the large number of trainable parameters. In this paper, we propose a training technique for transformers that prepares the training windows through random sampling. As input time steps need not be consecutive, the number of distinct samples increases from linearly to combinatorially many. By breaking the temporal order, this technique also helps transformers to capture dependencies among time steps in finer granularity. We achieve competitive results compared to the state-of-the-art on real-world datasets.},

  abstract = {Recent research on reinforcement learning (RL) has suggested that trained agents are vulnerable to maliciously crafted adversarial samples. In this work, we show how such samples can be generalised from White-box and Grey-box attacks to a strong Black-box case, where the attacker has no knowledge of the agents, their training parameters and their training methods. We use sequence-to-sequence models to predict a single action or a sequence of future actions that a trained agent will make. First, we show our approximation model, based on time-series information from the agent, consistently predicts RL agents' future actions with high accuracy in a Black-box setup on a wide range of games and RL algorithms. Second, we find that although adversarial samples are transferable from the target model to our RL agents, they often outperform random Gaussian noise only marginally. This highlights a serious methodological deficiency in previous work on such agents; random jamming should have been taken as the baseline for evaluation. Third, we propose a novel use for adversarial samplesin Black-box attacks of RL agents: they can be used to trigger a trained agent to misbehave after a specific time delay. This appears to be a genuinely new type of attack. It potentially enables an attacker to use devices controlled by RL agents as time bombs.},

The intuition behind this approach is that forecasts of a time series are themselves good features characterizing the series, especially when the modelling purpose is forecasting. It can also be viewed as a weighted ensemble method.

Many real-life time series data are driven by multiple latent components which occur at different frequencies. Existing solutions to time series forecasting fail to identify and discriminate these frequency-domain components. Inspired by the recent advent of signal processing and speech recognition techniques that decompose a time series signal into its time-frequency representation - a scalogram (or spectrogram), this paper proposes to explicitly disclose frequency-domain information from a univariate time series using wavelet transform, towards improving forecasting accuracy. Based on the transformed data, we leverage different neural networks to capture local time-frequency features and global long-term trend simultaneously. We further employ the attention mechanism to fuse local and global features in an effective manner. The experimental results on real time series show that our proposed approach achieves better performance than various baseline methods.},

  abstract = {In sequence to sequence learning, the self-attention mechanism proves to be highly effective, and achieves significant improvements in many tasks. However, the self-attention mechanism is not without its own flaws. Although self-attention can model extremely long dependencies, the attention in deep layers tends to overconcentrate on a single token, leading to insufficient use of local information and difficultly in representing long sequences. In this work, we explore parallel multi-scale representation learning on sequence data, striving to capture both long-range and short-range language structures. To this end, we propose the Parallel MUlti-Scale attEntion (MUSE) and MUSE-simple. MUSE-simple contains the basic idea of parallel multi-scale sequence representation learning, and it encodes the sequence in parallel, in terms of different scales with the help from self-attention, and pointwise transformation. MUSE builds on MUSE-simple and explores combining convolution and self-attention for learning sequence representations from more different scales. We focus on machine translation and the proposed approach achieves substantial performance improvements over Transformer, especially on long sequences. More importantly, we find that although conceptually simple, its success in practice requires intricate considerations, and the multi-scale attention must build on unified semantic space. Under common setting, the proposed model achieves substantial performance and outperforms all previous models on three main machine translation tasks. In addition, MUSE has potential for accelerating inference due to its parallelism. Code will be available at https://github.com/lancopku/MUSE.},

In the online prediction setup, existing conformal methods can provably achieve calibration assuming no distribution shift; however, the assumption is difficult to verify, and unlikely to hold in many applications such as time series prediction. Inspired by control theory, we propose a prediction algorithm that guarantees calibration even under distribution shift, and achieves strong performance on metrics such as sharpness and proper scores. We compare our method with baselines on 19 time-series and regression datasets, and our method achieves approximately 2x reduction in calibration error, comparable sharpness, and improved downstream decision utility.},

It differs from conventional dictionary learning and sparse coding where the latent basis has the same dimension as the input vectors, where the focus is on global patterns instead of shift-invariant local patterns. Unsupervised discovery of shift-invariant dictionary and the corresponding sparse coding has been an open challenge as the number of candidate local patterns is extremely large, and the number of possible linear combinations of such local patterns is even more so. In this paper we propose a new framework for unsupervised discovery of both the shift-invariant basis and the sparse coding of input data, with efficient algorithms for tractable computation. Empirical evaluations on multiple time series data sets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method.},

In this paper, we propose Highest Density Interval Regression Forest (HDI-Forest), a novel quality-based PI estimation method that is instead based on Random Forest. HDI-Forest does not require additional model training, and directly reuses the trees learned in a standard Random Forest model. By utilizing the special properties of Random Forest, HDIForest could efficiently and more directly optimize the PI quality metrics. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets show that HDI-Forest significantly outperforms previous approaches, reducing the average PI width by over 20\% while achieving the same or better coverage probability.},

Efficient estimation of the considered scoring rules and evaluation methods such as the DieboldMariano test are discussed. In detailed simulation studies, we compare the performance of the renowned scoring rules and the ones we propose. Besides extended synthetic studies based on recently published results we also consider a real data example. We find that the energy score, which is probably the most widely used multivariate scoring rule, performs comparably well in detecting forecast errors, also regarding dependencies. This contradicts other studies. The results also show that a proposed copula score provides very strong distinction between models with correct and incorrect dependency structure. We close with a comprehensive discussion on the proposed methodology.},
