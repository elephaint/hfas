The experiments on the public M5 dataset from our paper can be replicated by running the scripts in the [src](https://github.com/elephaint/hfas/tree/main/src/) folder. The m5 dataset can be downloaded from [here](https://github.com/Mcompetitions/M5-methods). In particular, the files _calendar.csv_, _sales\_train\_evaluation.csv_ and _sell\_prices.csv_ should be put in the folder `src\exp_m5\data`.
